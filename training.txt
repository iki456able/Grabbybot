Rievakins:
is rfb just for waifu material?

c3:
she's okay, but nowhere near as good as she's hyped up to be

commie:
she has a niche gameplay mechanic

c3:
^ meme skill

Rievakins:
yeah I could tell

Rievakins:
but is it because same artist as suomi?

Rievakins:
also I dropped a pk on 0-2

commie:
maybe she can easily delete the backline if you kite with your main tank?

commie:
but even then it's a 6 second initial cooldown

Rievakins:
yeah an ar wanting to be an rf

commie:
are you bullying me, young mister

Rievakins:
plus doesn't she have really bad rof?

c3:
if you need a backline deleter you put in a rof rf that doesn't need to rely on initial cd

Rievakins:
even though high dmg

commie:
eh ROF isn't that much of an issue

commie:
she has quite some high damage so it balances it a bit out

commie:
you can always buff RoF with SMGs, she'll still be slow but it's not crippling

c3:
that's why we see so many ump9 squads, eh?

commie:
my UMP9 is sitting there waiting for me to pull extras to link her :V

commie:
was thinking about vector actually

Ceia:
RFB is a DMR

Ceia:
so

Ceia:
go figure <:springTea:427818533431410691>

Shatterstar Nova:
ump9 has the strongest debuff

Shatterstar Nova:
oh w8 that 45 kek

Shatterstar Nova:
vector beats 9 <:toot:414068992114688003>

commie:
I have type 79 so there's no real point in investing on ump9 yet, though she'll have an event focused on her team later on

commie:
but yeah, vector has a better buff

Sparkee100:
Ump9 is great ok

Sparkee100:
She just wants a family

WhiteKnight:
Which 404 will be first to die for real in the story?

Kitsune:
is this a legitimate question or is it mad guessing

WhiteKnight:
The latter

Frabjous:
None

Rievakins:
ump9

Frabjous:
Tbh

Rievakins:
because she sacrifice herself

Rievakins:
ump9 is actual big sister.

c3:
g11, pierced by shell fragments because she didn't move in time because asleep

Rievakins:
bless her little firing chamber.

c3:
*it was just a question of time*

WhiteKnight:
My garbage child...

Rievakins:
nah

Rievakins:
416 will probably be dragging sleepo

c3:
yeah, or 416 as she once again tries to drag the narcoleptic hobo out of danger

Rievakins:
but you still gotta give them credit of being actual soldiers

Rievakins:
so first to go is ump9 cos shes probably the first to sacrifice herself

Frabjous:
Maybe t91 if you don't have groza

Luxanna:
RFB is niche af though

Luxanna:
and she's one of the t-dolls you can't idiotically run with auto skill on

Frabjous:
Well there isn't any other doll worth pulling for

Luxanna:
well

Luxanna:
pull for all of them

Vinen:

Chaotix:
i need bucks

WhiteKnight:
Well iirc they ran this one in August

Slave to the Caffeine:
hey slugs are good

Slave to the Caffeine:
as fodder

Slave to the Caffeine:
:D

WhiteKnight:
I went hog wild on it

Chaotix:
well who to give slugs

Chaotix:
whose sg?

Slave to the Caffeine:
slugs are terrible

WhiteKnight:
Now that I make 200 batteries a day myself I don't want it

Slave to the Caffeine:
you generally will never use them

Slave to the Caffeine:
so you can just use them to upgrade your crit scope or whatever else

Chaotix:
afaik only usasis good for using slugs right?

Lilya Starikova:
im not sure if

Lilya Starikova:
I should Put Shrimp as main tank or Type 79

Lilya Starikova:
but type 79 has weird tiles

Lilya Starikova:
<:thonk9:410657576892497930>

WhiteKnight:
Shrimp as a main tank? Nah.

WhiteKnight:
She needs to NOT get hit

WhiteKnight:
Gotta keep those dummies alive

Slave to the Caffeine:
USAS is ok with slugs

Lilya Starikova:
hmmm

Lilya Starikova:
what to use instead of Shrimp

Lilya Starikova:
PPS-43?

Lilya Starikova:
PP-90?

Slave to the Caffeine:
whats your formation right now

HazardousJay:
PPS-43

Lilya Starikova:
look uh

HazardousJay:
as an off-tank of course

Lilya Starikova:
Im making

Lilya Starikova:
a 6th echelon here

Slave to the Caffeine:
ah

Slave to the Caffeine:
what do you have available

Slave to the Caffeine:
i mean as far as offtanks go, if all else fails, vector

Lilya Starikova:
im thinking to make use of G36, Rib,Zas, Shrimp,T-79

Lilya Starikova:
vector is on 4th echelon

Lilya Starikova:
level 90 vector

Slave to the Caffeine:
ah

WhiteKnight:
Tbh SMG cohesion is hard to do sometimes

Slave to the Caffeine:
yeah thats why i started dupine gaming

Lilya Starikova:


Slave to the Caffeine:
im raising a second ump45

Lilya Starikova:
<:thonk9:410657576892497930>

WhiteKnight:
But I honestly think Welrod's skill makes her a decent sub for most main tank smgs
The problem is getting more of her

Slave to the Caffeine:
ah yes thats true

Lilya Starikova:
i may need to dupe game vector if i have to

Slave to the Caffeine:
i used her for awhile

Slave to the Caffeine:
my rifles needed her more

Slave to the Caffeine:
so vector replaced her

Lilya Starikova:
i may end up Placing IDW

Lilya Starikova:
if anything gets worst

Lilya Starikova:
OR

Lilya Starikova:
get a SHipka

Lilya Starikova:
Experimental

Lilya Starikova:
not yet finalized

Lilya Starikova:
also removed the high level ones just to make this formation

Slave to the Caffeine:
i need to buy more echelons

Lilya Starikova:

Slave to the Caffeine:
7 isnt enough

Lilya Starikova:
im at 6th ech atm

Luxanna:
what the fuck

Luxanna:


Luxanna:
kalina

Luxanna:
why do you gib worse rewards

Luxanna:
when your affection is higher

Luxanna:
<:roCry:414084703323160576>

Slave to the Caffeine:
looks like a great reward to me

Luxanna:
I mean

Luxanna:
yesterday her affection went up

Luxanna:
and like

Luxanna:
3 days ago she gave me **150** basic training data

Slave to the Caffeine:
her affection has nothing to do with what she gives you

Strela:
why tf I kept doing this??? <:SOPMODfunnyfeic:427804752701554719>

Luxanna:
afaik her gifts are affection based

Slave to the Caffeine:
nope

Slave to the Caffeine:
just random

ok but remember the alamo?:
dude fuck birds sometimes

Rievakins:
tbh all my ar gives dodge buff kek

Pungey:
Problem with 416 is that she is taking up prime estate that is the 7 position

Rievakins:
do you give rof buff?

Rievakins:
what do you put in 7?

Pungey:
7 takes buffs from both main and off tank plus buffer AR at 4 if you are running M4A1/ribey

Rievakins:
tfw no ots

Rievakins:
just g41

Pungey:
Nade dolls dont bring enough to sit in such a prime location, at least in EN

Rievakins:
and no g11

Rievakins:
welrod can be my main tank tho

Rievakins:
also how good i g36? Her buffs seems amazing.

Pungey:
Average stats and skill on the doll, great tiles

Rievakins:
doesn't seem like theres a lot of ar that buff dmg

Pungey:
~~you can also ask her to show you her pantsu while looking at you disgusted~~

Rievakins:
oats on the other hand seems really good with shrimp

Rievakins:
though doesn't shrimp benefit most from rof?

KnockFan:
IIRC, SR-3MP's ACC at max w/o any type of equips/buffs is like 1X.

Rievakins:
12

Pungey:
FP buffs > rof buffs in general

KnockFan:
Pretty much beyond awful.  Can't really have that damage if all you see are "Miss."  SMGs natural shoot fast anyways, no?

Rievakins:
yeah so why not max out their rof?

Rievakins:
or does groza already do that?

Pungey:
Shrimp has 90 rof at lvl 100, which leaves room for only 1 rof buff anyway at best

Rievakins:
assuming my math is correct welrod and ots would give shrimp 125 rof

Rievakins:
so 120 max

Pungey:
Practical rof cap is 116 not 120

Pungey:
Due to how frames work

Rievakins:
I thought they updated the frames or so

Rievakins:
so it got increased.

Pungey:
Yeah, it went up from 108

Rievakins:
oh

Rievakins:
well I guess that would mean one welrod would give her good enough rof

Pungey:
How about not using welrod for arsmg?

Rievakins:
y

Rievakins:
well I have ump45

Pungey:
Her tanking ability tends to be overestimated

Rievakins:
but shes only lvl 45 rn

Rievakins:
cos recently gotten

Pungey:
She is the best of her class, but her health is still HG tier

Rievakins:
also for some reason I have 5 ump45

Rievakins:
0 ump9

Pungey:
She isnt gonna beat a dedicated SMG tank and shouldnt be relied on to do so

somerandom101person:
I have an UMP9 bu no UMP45 yet. ~~I guess my recipes are not flat. I'll make it flatter.~~

Pungey:
<:umpOwO:500681384226979840>

Rievakins:
some people are saying use crit scope with shrimp

Pacbough:
depends on shrimps accuracy including buffs

Pacbough:
you want her to have 35 acc so use the appropriate scope depending on what buffs she has

you got 8 days actually, theres still hope

Aydensnake:
I got Negev as my first 5 star T-Doll, but at what cost?

salty emp:
nah

salty emp:
he's got 8

Sparkee100:
<:hkStare2:414084643848192006>

HazardousJay:
nevermind those high-tier dolls that are a bitch to link

somerandom101person:
<@142434013892575233> me too man. My squad is still weak even if I have like 10k power.

CptHenry:
Negev, huh

WhiteKnight:
it's your call to whaling

HazardousJay:
get BM-59 and M14

HazardousJay:
and hope for the best

Aydensnake:
yeah, at least I got a t-doll that is godly at killing tankier bosses

Aydensnake:
wait, I might be able to abuse this

Aydensnake:
if I can stack evasion so goddamn high I might be able to make this work

Aydensnake:
Battles will take a long time, but that's what negev is for

CptHenry:
BM-59 is a cute

WhiteKnight:
Elphelt wrecks my +10 gold exo full enhancement level 100 ump45 on the regular

WhiteKnight:
You gotta burst her down

Aydensnake:
oh fuck, won't be able to grind for level 100 in just 8 days

somerandom101person:
You cant dodge nuclear bombs.

Aydensnake:
I do have ump45 though

salty emp:
I'm a tw player and I started a EN account a few days ago to try my luck on elphelt

WhiteKnight:
I don't dodge nukes, I retreat

WhiteKnight:
It's her normal attack that really hurts...

salty emp:
and then mica announced GGBB collaboration rerun for older servers

Aydensnake:
So we might get a rerun too?

salty emp:
two years down the line

salty emp:
maybe

WhiteKnight:
In like two years!

Sparkee100:
Nisue

Aydensnake:
Hey, I'll be ready by then

Aydensnake:
and we'll be close to S.T.A.L.K.E.R 2 coming out

CptHenry:
I've only been playing for a few months

McSparky:
I love elphelt...but she's got a problem that bugs the everliving shit outta me

CptHenry:
What's that

Sparkee100:
Which is?

McSparky:


Stillman61:
Double shotty

Aydensnake:
IT JUST WORKS

McSparky:
It's like this is combat too, not just training

CptHenry:
LITERALLY

somerandom101person:
Imagine if Mccree is in GFL?

CptHenry:
UNPLAYABLE

Sparkee100:
She is double tappin so fast

KnockFan:
Elphelt channeling her inner K-Style tricks.

McSparky:
I'm pretty sure her magnum wedding places it UNDER the gun a bit

Aydensnake:
Nah, imagine if we had good 'ol Strelok in GFL

Aydensnake:
~~I really fucking need that stalker collab~~

WhiteKnight:
SAA McCree skin

WhiteKnight:
McCree SAA skin

McSparky:
Psh....McCree skin my arse

McSparky:
John Marston

WhiteKnight:
No but listen

WhiteKnight:
SAA voiced by Daisuke Ono

somerandom101person:
T-Doll with Dead eye ability.

WhiteKnight:
Wait I confused my voice actor regions

McSparky:
Kek

Aydensnake:
>Things a potential stalker collab could give us
>Gauss Rifle
>Various S.T.A.L.K.E.R themed skins for some weapons that appear ingame
>Some random female stalker pulled from the zone, female stalkers were initially planned for stalker 2 before the original cancellation

salty emp:
TOPIC

Aydensnake:
Okay üò¶

somerandom101person:
T-dolls from Warframe's weapons.

Aydensnake:
OH FUCK YES

Kyle:
dear god

Kyle:
the options there

Aydensnake:
>Soma Prime transfers over as the new meta AR
>downright absurd crit

Kyle:
its not meta anymore tho

somerandom101person:
Shotgun with grenade launcher :p

Sparkee100:
Ew Soma

Aydensnake:
In GFL it would be, high DPS and high crit

McSparky:
Back to SAA skins....what about a Revolver Ocelot uniform??

Kyle:
give us the opticor, literally a spartan laser as a t doll

Sparkee100:
Opticor man of culture

somerandom101person:
Corinth i say is a good shotgun

Aydensnake:
Or the Arca Plasmor, basically the BFG

somerandom101person:
Might as well just grenade launcher like 416.

Aydensnake:
Ideally, a warframe collab would have 1 weapon from each faction

somerandom101person:
Corinth anyone?

Sparkee100:
Arca plasmor another one

Aydensnake:
one tenno weapon, one grineer weapon, one corpus weapon, one infested weapon, and one orokin weapon

McSparky:
That'd actually be kinda sicm

Aydensnake:
granted, orokin could fit as a tenno weapon but euphona prime doesn't have a normal variant

McSparky:
Sick*

McSparky:
Omfg

Sparkee100:
My most used kit is opticor, arca plasmor, pandero, pyrana (before prime) and guandao

Sparkee100:
:3

somerandom101person:
10/10 would kill vor with our echelons.

McSparky:
Quick question Ayden, would infested be skinned as an SF unit?

Aydensnake:
Maybe mutalist infested?

Kyle:
braton as a yandere t doll with abandonment issues

Kyle:
yes please

WhiteKnight:
Granted, g11 is an active that lasts 4 seconds and PKP's is always on

Ruzike:
<:umpOwO:500681384226979840>

Slave to the Caffeine:
god you know you got fucked over when you can say "I got fucked harder than mica fucked Kar98k" and not be exagerating

Ruzike:
<:hkStare2:414084643848192006>

WhiteKnight:
Watch kar be the only 5* to get a mod

WhiteKnight:
To make up for no rarity bump she gets two more special equips

~sopposilver~:
kar isnt bad tho

~sopposilver~:
shes useful in CN for streylets

~sopposilver~:
<:g36Lazy:481469060589027329>

c3:
kar mod bumps her to 6*
still worse than m14

c3:
<:RibBleeding:415391866822066176>

Some_Person:
<:M4A1depression:410654965892382721>

CptHenry:
Is an IWS echelon worth making atm?

c3:
at present we have nothing that would warrant it. doesn't mean it's not fun to have regardless

CptHenry:
I mean I have her around

CptHenry:
Might as well prepare for the future I guess

WhiteKnight:
Bully Destroyer with IWS

c3:
I leveled and skilled all the dolls, then never used her

c3:
ü§∑

KnockFan:
She'll be for you to train to futureproof if anything, Henry.

Aydensnake:
Finally got the constant nox crashes fixed

Aydensnake:
it was AVG the entire time

CptHenry:
So she's meant for super high armored targets, right?

CptHenry:
Or just really beefy enemies?

WhiteKnight:
Both is fine

Aydensnake:
Turns out AVG really does not work well with android emulators

Cabbage:
Why are you using avg

WhiteKnight:
The trick is over buffing her RoF so that it's as high as possible in her big damage mode

Aydensnake:
It isn't are anymore

CptHenry:
I imagine IWS isn't meant to take on a lot of enemies at once?

Aydensnake:
it's a was

Aydensnake:
I uninstalled it

Cabbage:
Just attach a picture of a wall to your computer and it's safe from infections and viruses

Cabbage:
Problem solved

Cabbage:
Another good deed done

Cabbage:
<:minkLove:427816604659613707>

c3:
She's best used for beefy single or low amount of targets

Aydensnake:
I just use malwarebytes and windows defender now

Cabbage:
Ye same

CptHenry:
Kk

Aydensnake:
free version because am poor

WhiteKnight:
For her actual buffers I recommend m950a, welrod, and 5-7 for Rozf and crit and a little damage, Contender for more crit and damage, and sub out a non-welrod for Grizzly to make welrod tank better

Aydensnake:
Sangvis Ferri T-Doll usable for players when?

WhiteKnight:
Sangvis capture is coming

Aydensnake:
So soon‚Ñ¢?

CptHenry:
Alrighty then, thank ya

WhiteKnight:
I want to make a 2* sangvis echelon but they'll probably only make ringleaders useable

Cabbage:
For us probably not

c3:
except it won't truly be capture in the sense of the word, and they're still working on it. so probs not very soon

WhiteKnight:
RIP Ripper-chan

CptHenry:
Renegade Sangvis dolls would be cool

c3:
if anything, from what we could gather so far it seems like it's going to be a kind of alliance system

CptHenry:
>tfw your 50 combat reports only raises Rib from 45 to 55

Aydensnake:
Really wish we'd just get all of the CN content at once in a big update

Aydensnake:
or at least the non-event stuff since events need to be spaced out

Rose ‚ôß:
Lol no

Rose ‚ôß:
We'd be sitting on top of difficulty spikes if that was the case

c3:
then a lot of people would throw their hands into the air that they can't instantly complete all the content, forget that maybe there's grinding and all that involved and we'd lose a lot of players

Rose ‚ôß:
Story content is released in different segments and difficulties

KnockFan:
Sounds like KR server in a nutshell, Church.

Aydensnake:
Well, here's to hoping content starts coming to the EN server quicker at least

Aydensnake:
hell, could probably get volunteers for translating

c3:
that much at least they promised

Rose ‚ôß:
Some want more content, some think it's just the right pace

somerandom101person:
I just found this image.

WhiteKnight:
Saru is dangerous...

c3:
good old times. practical problem solving

McSparky:
<:SOPMODfunnyfeic:427804752701554719>

CptHenry:
Think these will be enough for Elphelt's and her map?

WhiteKnight:
Which one is fighting Elphelt

The Laughing Man:
Hmm

CptHenry:
Second one

The Laughing Man:
I would switch Sop with G11

The Laughing Man:
And RO with UMP45

CptHenry:
Why SOP and G11?

The Laughing Man:
Cause that team is meta af

WhiteKnight:
Shrimp would enjoy the accuracy

CptHenry:
I have a red dot on her though

WhiteKnight:
Well it's only GGBB

WhiteKnight:
Should be fine

The Laughing Man:
But yeah, G11, M4, AR15, Vector, UMP45 is the most meta ARSMG team right now

WhiteKnight:
Don't forget to X formation when you start the boss

CptHenry:
Yerp

CptHenry:
GGBB?

The Laughing Man:
The current collab

CptHenry:
Oh

CptHenry:
Right

The Laughing Man:
Is Guilty Gear and BlazBlue

CptHenry:
Alright, I'll switch 'em around and see how it goes

CptHenry:
Gotta wait for the second one to get back from logistics

Aydensnake:
still waiting for that S.T.A.L.K.E.R collab, need a gauss rifle T-Doll

Aydensnake:
It'll likely never happen, but a man can dream damnit

noonefromithaca:
Does she get Slug or Buckshot

salty emp:
the promotional poster didn't have a sneak peak for a new girl
So I doubt it

Kitsune:
~~seele, thanks~~

Kitsune:

suguri:
lord of war costume is probably based off the nicholas cage film of the same name

FlueneCha:
It also mentions that

FlueneCha:
I quoted the wiki lol

Kzar:
<@250107701688926208> buckshot

Kzar:
Slugs don't scale with skills

~sopposilver~:

Kitsune:

salty emp:

~sopposilver~:
<:homeThonk:484732324198744097> i wonder if kits like seele

~sopposilver~:
<:fncFat:502098769379196928>

KnockFan:
Well, isn't it confirmed that people aren't getting an extra Elphelt though?

~sopposilver~:
kits do you like seele by any chance <:karlicious:414085222217416705>

~sopposilver~:
not exactly sure tbh

~sopposilver~:
they cant get one from e4 again

~sopposilver~:
but we dont know the extra parts they are adding

~sopposilver~:
they may make a new unit or just let you get another

~sopposilver~:
or nothing at all and just do it for fun

salty emp:
<@153068340145946624> he's talking about a NEW girl aside of elphelt and noel

KnockFan:
Mmkay.  Chimed in a bit late.

FlueneCha:
They should put Rachel ingame too

FlueneCha:
Best BB waifu

salty emp:
you know mica

salty emp:
they aren't that bright

Kitsune:
ooc

~sopposilver~:
ü§î still no clue tho

salty emp:
especially after VC collab failing left them shocked and distraught

Kitsune:
*oof

~sopposilver~:
<:springTea:427818533431410691> its either be shook

~sopposilver~:
or have a repeat of dolls frontline

FlueneCha:
What collab?

KnockFan:
Valkyrie Chronicles.

FlueneCha:
Oh

~sopposilver~:
and thank you but mica has been through enough in that department\

The Laughing Man:
Mmm yeah I hope this teaches Mica to make backup plans in case their negotiations fail

The Laughing Man:
The whole VC collab situation that is

FlueneCha:
Pick game with better waifus instead

FlueneCha:
<:SOPMODfunnyfeic:427804752701554719>

The Laughing Man:
But no other games have waifus as good as GFL

Kitsune:
honk collab again thanks

The Laughing Man:
<:SOPMODfunnyfeic:427804752701554719>

WhiteKnight:
Alicia is a great waifu but she's got a man

Kitsune:
<:OK:500692128058572800>

~sopposilver~:

~sopposilver~:

~sopposilver~:

FlueneCha:
HI collab would be <:OK:500692128058572800>

~sopposilver~:
yes mica do it

~sopposilver~:
i wanna watch kits grind for another seele

KnockFan:
Well, they do have a JPN server.  They can always dig through more and more options.

salty emp:
I would love to have a chloe

~sopposilver~:
<:SOPwao:465878170046955521>

FlueneCha:
Gibe Kallen on GFL pls

The Laughing Man:
Who's Kallen

The Laughing Man:
From Code Geass?

somerandom101person:
Overwatch collab anyone?

FlueneCha:
HI Kallen

Kitsune:
no

Kitsune:
i just want more content regarding 416 and M16's relationship

Kitsune:
thanks

salty emp:
KEK

salty emp:
nice one

The Laughing Man:
Did they ever expand on that relationship?

somerandom101person:
Didnt know 416 and M16 have relationship.

WhiteKnight:
Code Geass collab?

The Laughing Man:
Like give us backstory

WhiteKnight:
Deep Dive

The Laughing Man:
Mmkay

FlueneCha:
I meant Honkai Impact <:SOPMODfunnyfeic:427804752701554719>

WhiteKnight:
I know it's poking 45's memories about a certain op

CptHenry:
If I have three of the big four, is PKP (and Mk48 since she's a waifu) still worth going after?

The Laughing Man:
Yes

c3:
pkp is by far the best

The Laughing Man:
Especially for Mk48

WhiteKnight:
PKP is kind of their queen

The Laughing Man:
Mk48 is definitely waifu material

KnockFan:
If you have nothing else to aim for other T-Doll classes, then continue on with MG.

The Laughing Man:
Would want her to step on me

Sparkee100:
negev

CptHenry:
I kind of have all of the major ARs

WhiteKnight:
Her main body cheats out ~20% free bullets that always crit

CptHenry:
Except the Type Sisters

The Laughing Man:
I thought PKP's skill applies to all her dummies

WhiteKnight:
But that's at sl10

WhiteKnight:
I asked about it today

~sopposilver~:
god next big event

~sopposilver~:
please be m16's event

WhiteKnight:
G11's does, but pkp is just her main

The Laughing Man:
What's M16's event?

Peppermint Tea:
My mistake

FlueneCha:
Increasing CD would be a bad thing

hamster42:
what have i done

FlueneCha:
Kek

Peppermint Tea:
I'm sleepy <:g36Lazy:481469060589027329>

FlueneCha:
I guess you could say increases CDR

QuazzyWazzy:
They can kill everyone in one rotation anyway, I think CD is not much of an issue (as of now)

Jazaia Taizago:
Go to sleep, then? It's 04:18 AM here. But i got a reason to stay up.

Peppermint Tea:

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:

Peppermint Tea:
A pistol with no ammo/food

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
you mean farming for chip?

Ayeccs:
so you can save ammo/rations when restarting

QuazzyWazzy:
i just noticed why does Saki look so much like PKP

Ayeccs:

Shatterstar Nova:

KnockFan:
Good luck fighting every current veteran, whales, etc.  Truthfully, it depends on really who's there.  IIRC, the optimal scope's 10% ranking?

Shatterstar Nova:
new fetish mastery unlocked

somerandom101person:
One day, I will buy that oath and give it to 416

Strela:
~~Why she turned into gangsta? Shouldn t she turned into gopnik with vodka and tracksuit?~~

WhiteKnight:
I mean I think it's called Lord of War

Strela:
Then u take it back and give it to m4 <:GudaCano:427805886757601280>

WhiteKnight:
Make of it what you will

FlueneCha:
Her costumes were based on the people who use the gun the most iirc

Strela:
Shit I almost said racist joke about that

FlueneCha:
A.k.a. the AK47 was popular with gangsters too

Strela:
<:hkStare2:414084643848192006>

somerandom101person:
I predict that if GFL anime is announced, anime fans will meme about GFL and America.

WhiteKnight:
You're now imagining 50cent with his 9x body AK-47 bodyguard entourage

salty emp:

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:

I think i'll be happy with just the skin... I could probably get a KSTSP though

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:

salty emp:
aiming high is always good

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:

Speaking of Elphelt

nguuuquaaa:
30% ROF 20% crit

Chaotix:
Unfortunately

Chaotix:
But i need to farm manticore

WhiteKnight:
I'd actually replace either mk23 or 5-7 for... Welr-

Keep 5-7

Peppermint Tea:
I'd rather use 45 than 5-7 then

FlueneCha:
I'd run Groza/RF

Shiki:
your HG cant stand against the 2 armored squads before reaching manticore assuming you only farm the 2 manticores and retreat

WhiteKnight:
Good argument for 45 or Welrod

Shiki:
i use 45

somerandom101person:
Manitcores? What are those?

Shiki:
45 smoke grenade helps alot

Chaotix:
Welrod IP

c3:
the problem that both ar's have a initial cd before they get to wreck shop on armor and in that time your hg's get toasted

Peppermint Tea:
If you can kite 45's smoke would be quite nice

Shiki:
the big 4 legs robot that counted as boss?

Chaotix:
Near x5

hamster42:
how do i make sure my rifles dont exceed rof cap?

Chaotix:
No

Armored machines

will it tell me?

Peppermint Tea:
<@297538939902885901> Why would you want NOT to cap it?

hamster42:
to make sure im not over doing it

WhiteKnight:
They don't want to waste too much buff

hamster42:
making sure this isnt to much

hamster42:


Peppermint Tea:
<@176278015737593856> Is 5-4 mixed or armor only?

FlueneCha:
Cross meme

FlueneCha:
Why

Chaotix:
Armor

Shiki:
armored only

Chaotix:
Full armor

Shiki:
but the manticore can dodge

An0n:
Just to make sure I'm not spamming, but has anyone posted a link to the translated first chapter of the GFL manga?

Chaotix:

Arcus:
get an smg

Chaotix:
Welrod is 87

hamster42:
i can easily raise her up though

Shiki:
why do you put 45 there

An0n:
Also rabbig, swap Welrod and 45

An0n:
and put Welrod on the top middle tile

Jazaia Taizago:
Better yet. A SG if you can afford the time and resources to get her pretty good.

Peppermint Tea:
<@176278015737593856> Keep grizz kick 5-7

An0n:
and if you don't ahve a Grizzly, SAA works out neatly there as well

dropkick_tm:
Quick question, playing gfl in nox wont get me banned right?

Arcus:
no

QuazzyWazzy:
nope

Peppermint Tea:
Nope

FlueneCha:
No lol

Jazaia Taizago:
Uh. No? I'm playing it on Nox.

Shiki:
unless you use macro

dropkick_tm:
Kannayay.gif

Shiki:
emulator usually dont get you banned

Peppermint Tea:
It might get some dirty bugs tho <:mk48LUL:500681251733110785>

Shiki:
~~and then we have nintendo~~

Jazaia Taizago:
I can't get it on my Phone for some reason. I've long wanted to ask how i get it on my Phone in a normal way, without having to re-download it to update it.

Chaotix:


Peppermint Tea:
Imagine welrod getting stuck in limbo for one week

Peppermint Tea:
<:mk48LUL:500681251733110785>

HazardousJay:
<:SOPMODfunnyfeic:427804752701554719>

Shiki:
pay attention to your welrod

Shiki:
they can 2 shots your HG

Chaotix:
Ok this is enough

Jazaia Taizago:
Also. About macro. You really don't have to macro GFL at all. It's a pretty straightforward game, though can get a bit difficult to learn what's current the meta and effective Dolls.

Chaotix:
But then i should kite welrod and umps

Peppermint Tea:
<@297538939902885901> Don't do cross, it'll get your sniper rifles damaged

hamster42:
rip

FlueneCha:
Just run generic F WAVD

FlueneCha:
lol

Jazaia Taizago:
I usually put my RFs all the way back and form the frontline of the Tanks, and rest goes middle usually.

Jazaia Taizago:
Tends to work nearly all the time.

Chaotix:
What should be my other echelon

Peppermint Tea:
Go like this:
Wawa Welrod
Grizzly Calico
SVD  <@297538939902885901>

Peppermint Tea:
Swap welrod with calico at the start of battle for ninja evades

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
thank god for welrod's ultra instinct

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
<:springTea:427818533431410691>

QuazzyWazzy:
It works better if you swap out SVD and Wa2k

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
no need

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
wa needs more buff

FlueneCha:
I don't move them too lazy I also run gold exo on calico for it

hamster42:
k

QuazzyWazzy:
WA2k can already cap her RoF with Calico buff alone

Peppermint Tea:
I prefer it with Wa on top

Peppermint Tea:
Since she increases welrod's cd

Chaotix:
What should be my other echelon for 5-4

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
yes with RoF but she needs more damage

QuazzyWazzy:
SVD still needs a bit of help

Chaotix:
Well for increase movements?

FlueneCha:
Also decreases CD

Peppermint Tea:
Er yes

FlueneCha:
FGO is cursed don't play

Tsukicchi:

WhiteKnight:

The Laughing Man:
When EN gets GGBB rerun it'll come back

Sheodoq:

Sheodoq:

deadlymessenger:
<@!409526372537729046> Slug does work with Seele's skill, yes, as it's merely helping reload

~sopposilver~:

Sheodoq:
USAS does decent work slugs

Sheodoq:

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:

deadlymessenger:
damage multiplier is only on the last shell in her tube

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
<:thonk9:410657576892497930>

Sheodoq:
My USAS does 90 damage with slugs on

~sopposilver~:
<:SOPMODfunnyfeic:427804752701554719> we need to ask vec to somehow give en seele

WhiteKnight:
I fed my 5* slug a 5* slug and it went straight to +3

Sheodoq:
Though I have MK48 buffing her

The Laughing Man:
I still need Mk48 <:roCry:414084703323160576>

Tsukicchi:

Sheodoq:
Rip

WhiteKnight:

Sheodoq:

Sheodoq:
So it's not bad

~sopposilver~:
<:fncFat:502098769379196928> later dolls can get to 17k nades smol

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:

Sheodoq:
Don't forget SOPMOD = cores get yourself a HK416

Kitsune:
<:NOPE:500694246429556757>

WhiteKnight:
Hold up
If I wanted to kill KCCO laser tanks i'm supposed to avoid is 416 a good option?

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
M4A1 "nade" does higher dmg

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
<:fncFat:502098769379196928>

Kitsune:
no

Tsukicchi:
So forget 416 and get other nade girls?

Kitsune:

Kitsune:

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:

Kitsune:

WhiteKnight:
I guess everything but HGs are too slow

Sheodoq:
Just slam them with a fast girl with AP

Kitsune:
Why wouldn't you use her

Sheodoq:
6P-62 can technically do it

~sopposilver~:
thunder should be able to get to 20k+ skill damage at night <:fncFat:502098769379196928>

~sopposilver~:
<:SOPwao:465878170046955521> but ye kit if you ever get px4 she would do great in shrimps place

Kitsune:
i don't have px4

Kitsune:
:(

Kitsune:
i'd train her if i could

The Laughing Man:
I thought Px4 is only used in RFHG

Kitsune:
i think i mentioned not having Px4 on stream lmao

~sopposilver~:
üò¶ i wish px4 upon kits

ok but remember the alamo?:
i ran elphet map twice and only got one box

ok but remember the alamo?:
what

~sopposilver~:
o i missed that part sadly

~sopposilver~:
skill kept interupting

Kitsune:
you gotta S rank elphelt

ok but remember the alamo?:
really?

The Laughing Man:
Probably cause you didn't get S rank on Elphelt battle

The Laughing Man:
Yeah

~sopposilver~:
and px4 works in arsmg echelons laughing <:fncFat:502098769379196928>

~sopposilver~:
mainly because with m4 and 45 you will have 88%

Kitsune:
with fairy

~sopposilver~:
but units like sop rfb and auh with have 101

ok but remember the alamo?:
i dont think ive ever got an s on it, only a's

animerelatedlover:
Kitsune sauce to the pfp please

animerelatedlover:
<:BlobReach:414069175934386177>

The Laughing Man:
On Elphelt's battle

Kitsune:
it has a 60% chance of giving me 50% more crit rate

The Laughing Man:
Not the entire map

Kitsune:
oof

~sopposilver~:
with fairy you could get up to 3.15x damage with her skill active

ok but remember the alamo?:
oh

~sopposilver~:
~~para so not likely~~

~sopposilver~:
tho entertainingly if you go for px4 with your current echelon in the future <:BlobReach:414069175934386177> damage 2 would be better

~sopposilver~:
~~imo~~

Kitsune:
it'd actually be funny

Kitsune:
you know why

~sopposilver~:
o?

Kitsune:
my fairy's talent is 60% chance for 50% crit rate buff

Kitsune:
so even with px4, i could have 100% critrate

~sopposilver~:
kek

~sopposilver~:
that would be nice for 15

~sopposilver~:
wait

~sopposilver~:
ü§î

~sopposilver~:
at that point you technically wont need 45

~sopposilver~:
<:SOPMODfunnyfeic:427804752701554719>

Kitsune:
shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

~sopposilver~:
if you can get it to 5 star you could use a different main tank

Kitsune:
she's there to eat damage

Kitsune:
<:springTea:427818533431410691>

~sopposilver~:
<:SOPMODfunnyfeic:427804752701554719> kitsune you just gave me far to many theory crafting ideas

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
you animal ab·ªßs

~sopposilver~:
<:SOPwao:465878170046955521>  but what is a better maintank that could get sop her much needed rof and 15 he needed fp

~sopposilver~:
she could ü§î much better main tank for tanking

Kitsune:

Kitsune:
~~but why would you~~

~sopposilver~:
the rof will make sure 15 is capped and sop will be at around 90 ish rof give or take

~sopposilver~:
the acc will never hurt an ar

~sopposilver~:
ü§î

~sopposilver~:
im hoping one day they give ro a story event and mechanic to have rof and fp <:GudaCano:427805886757601280>

WhiteKnight:
AS-VAL needs a children's day skin so her voice and mannerisms actually fit

I wish the game gave us Honkai collab

~sopposilver~:
<:fncFat:502098769379196928> you could use px4 and get more out of sop and 15

~sopposilver~:
<:SOPwao:465878170046955521>

The Laughing Man:
Suomi Live2D is this Christmas's gacha

AsILie:

QuazzyWazzy:

Kitsune:

Kitsune:

The Laughing Man:

Kitsune:

~sopposilver~:
thats exactly what burst is

~sopposilver~:
<:g36Lazy:481469060589027329>

~sopposilver~:
a sudden amount of damage

SleepyDuck:
<:ShotMink:410655372840402945>

~sopposilver~:
<:g36Lazy:481469060589027329> burst works for either

SleepyDuck:
It doesnt

FlueneCha:
What

Rose ‚ôß:
What

SleepyDuck:
Burst implies a small but contained amount of damage for a short period of time

SleepyDuck:
Soppu is a nuke

FlueneCha:
Never saw anyone call naders nukes

Rose ‚ôß:
Let's just call this grenade a nuke and a nuke a grenade

SleepyDuck:
Ive been living a lie

AsILie:
They ARE only X3 tho

commie:
I don't have many more ARs not on logistics so I have a 3x and a 4x with a 5x RO on base defense

commie:
probably not

AsILie:
Thought so

commie:
maybe if they were higher levelled

FlueneCha:
Are they all SL10?

AsILie:
WA is

FlueneCha:
Eh prob not

AsILie:
SVD is 8, welrod 6, griz 5 calico is 5

commie:
yeah but his HG levels are really low

commie:
they won't handle the tanking he needs to do

commie:
a 3x WA with 5x HGs I could see it working

FlueneCha:
If he had all SL10 there probably wouldn't be much tanking to do

commie:
that's what you can do on E4, slap a 5x SMG in the middle and 3x ARs to grind exp

Rose ‚ôß:
All Asi needs is his HGs to be lvl 80 so he can slap on an exo

FlueneCha:
Well SL10 Calico and both RFs would probably be enough

commie:
does the base get attacked by those guys that run at you?

commie:
future content mobs I assume

Kitsune:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6F9blS5tPU&

commie:
self promotion reeeeeeeee

Kitsune:
it's unlisted

Kitsune:
i really don't care about views

commie:
yeah I can see this being better but we don't have it yet üò¶

AsILie:
I can prolly grind a few runs of E3 then blast a few power levels of 4-3E to raise the level of the HGRF squad

AsILie:
And put the SG MG squad on hold

FlueneCha:
SOP MOD3 is very recent too

commie:
>those discord noises

Kitsune:
sorry :(

FlueneCha:
So. .

Kitsune:
honestly speaking

Kitsune:
why i chose them is because of convenience

Kitsune:
they're at the top of my list

Kitsune:
lol

commie:
>spoilers too

commie:
wew

Kitsune:
<:SOPMODfunnyfeic:427804752701554719>

commie:
if you care about that don't look at soppo's portrait :V

commie:
if you saw it pretend you didn't

Kitsune:
just think of it as a skin

Kitsune:
yes a skin

Kitsune:
that's all it is

Kitsune:
<:SOPMODfunnyfeic:427804752701554719>

Kitsune:
honestly speaking

Kitsune:
idk if it's actually as effective as g11 or smth

commie:
I don't think we could tell, a lot more variables on the clear speed and m16 damage taken that we can't really compare with what we've got

commie:
I assume that there's the fairy and M16 with special equip and another exo

Kitsune:
nah, it's the standard gold exo

Kitsune:
no special equip

commie:
gold exo and armor?

Kitsune:
yes

commie:
hm, what might differ the most is the initial cooldown

commie:
4 seconds on the ST AR-15 and 6 seconds on the G11

Kitsune:
besides

Kitsune:
AR-15 has 10% echo

Kitsune:
15/16 uptime

Kitsune:
she's broken

commie:
g11 uptime is also kind of ass

commie:
at level 92 with max offensive equips there are still mobs standing after the skill ends, with 3 HGs (granted they aren't 5x)

commie:
at level 100 the same will probably happen but dunno how much fairies can change that

Kitsune:
the fairy i have on buffs damage by 26%

commie:
unconditional?

Kitsune:
it's multiplicative stacking on other buffs

Kitsune:
so... unconditional

Kitsune:
it's passive

commie:
do you not have a G11 at level 100 SL10? :V

Kitsune:
in addition, there's a 60% chance for its battle talent to activate, wherein it gives me a 50% crit rate buff

Kitsune:
which is insane for AR-15 since her special equipment adds crit damage

Kitsune:
i do have a g11 SL10, level 100

Kitsune:
rarely use her nowadays though

Kitsune:
mostly because my other AR options outshadow her quite a bit

FlueneCha:
How about the slav sisters?

Kitsune:
AK-12 and AN?

FlueneCha:
Ye

Kitsune:
they're level 94

Kitsune:
i think

Kitsune:
both SL10

commie:
I imagine those are the ones who would replace G11 later on

Kitsune:
i run them with AUG

Kitsune:
fun stuff

Kfish:
yall got any tapeworms

Kitsune:
so stuff to look forward to

Kitsune:
fairies are broken

commie:
also a pain in the ass to grind, it seems

Kitsune:
just look at my rsc

Kitsune:
that's from fairy crafting

Kitsune:
lul

Kfish:
I love springfield daily reminder 6‚É£ 9‚É£

commie:
still more than what I've got 8)

AsILie:
Then forgot for a few days

Sparkee100:
lol

AsILie:
I got an assload of reports tho

commie:
well, you gotta pray to get a noel from a random seithr drop or a map drop from E3

Sparkee100:
or 99 boxes

commie:
I mean, he can get 99 even if he's at 0 now

AsILie:
Gonna pump them into my new MG5 and shove that shitter into my SG/MG team with my 2k ammo and 1k rations

commie:
but he doesn't want to farm elphelt so at 8 a day it's too late

CptHenry:
I'm at 12 boxes

commie:
it's doable with ARSMG, how's your best ARSMG team?

Sparkee100:
oof

CptHenry:
Because I don't care about Noel

Sparkee100:
gg

AsILie:
4x linked

Sparkee100:
ye Noel is just trophy

Sparkee100:
kinda

Sparkee100:
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

commie:
that can clear but dunno if you'll manage an S

AsILie:
416, ar15, m4, 45, vector

AsILie:
All at 4x

Sparkee100:
keep going 8 per day

Sparkee100:
maybe u luck out

commie:
you might be able to if you take 2 elphelt shotgun blasts and retreat the 3rd one

AsILie:
Oh, yeah

AsILie:
She fucked the entire squad

commie:
the ARSMG one?

AsILie:
416 barely survived and let off with the nades

AsILie:
Yup

commie:
hm it shouldn't be too bad tbh even at 4x

Sparkee100:
416 pog

CptHenry:
It kind of is bad

commie:
I take 5x and she just gets deleted until her mechanics make her invincible

AsILie:
All you need <:hkStare2:414084643848192006>

commie:
did you do the mechanics, that is moving into an X and retreating the target?

CptHenry:
Even 4x can't kill the armored enemies before a super comes off

~sopposilver~:
for 0-2 if you are doing rof buffers sop and 416 are much much better <:BlobReach:414069175934386177>

AsILie:
No...

commie:
her super comes off at 50% hp

commie:
it doesn't depend on the time of the fight

Rose ‚ôß:
kill elphelt before her skill activates

Rose ‚ôß:
<:springTea:427818533431410691>

AsILie:
I've been playing simce the middle of cube and i hit 10k ce last week

~sopposilver~:
10k ce

~sopposilver~:
wot

AsILie:
I got my buddy into it a week before the collab and he's been stomping the boss

~sopposilver~:
casual?

AsILie:
Very

~sopposilver~:
shame

commie:
a week's a bit tough to level dolls but elphelt isn't that strong

AsILie:
Im not high enough level for comp csgo

~sopposilver~:
i need more fodder for my ranking in AW

~sopposilver~:
plebs grow <:SOPMODfunnyfeic:427804752701554719>

~sopposilver~:
make me rank higher due to your low levels

commie:
you can do it with 4x ARSMG

AsILie:
Yo but realshot

AsILie:
How tf dp you build the big4?

FlueneCha:
I want the AK47 hood skin

FlueneCha:
Dank shit

~sopposilver~:
mg
mg hg sg
mh

~sopposilver~:
thats how its normally built

~sopposilver~:
there are two other varients

AsILie:
I have all 4 jow

AsILie:
Now*

~sopposilver~:
one with 2 hgs and another with 2 sh;s

The Laughing Man:
Are you asking about how to build an MG individually or how to build an MGSG team?

AsILie:
M2hb, pkp, pk and mg5

FlueneCha:
I'll need to level my second mg team someday

~sopposilver~:
pkp pk mg5 mk23 and a shotgun

~sopposilver~:
boom

commie:
but what is your plan here?

AsILie:
I just need the resources

~sopposilver~:
make their tiles line up

commie:
are you looking to level an SGMG to clear the event?

AsILie:
Cause rage crafting shotguns is bad

AsILie:
And im dumb

AsILie:
Nah, just in general

FlueneCha:
I run MG5 PK BAR first team LWMMG PKP AEK second

AsILie:
Doubt that ill clear it now

commie:
you won't clear it if you give up üòê

AsILie:
I CAN clear it with my team

AsILie:
I just need more teams to help keep the base

commie:
the regular enemies on E4 are very weak

AsILie:
Cause the ones i have now get stomped harder than the bricks under famas

AsILie:
I've trained 2 teams

commie:
you don't have a reasonable amount of dolls for a second echelon? they don't even need to be 4x

AsILie:
ARSMG and HGRF

AsILie:
HGRF is Wa amd SVD hitting 7k CE

commie:
go with ARSMG, if you're not sufficiently levelled then the mob density will kill your rifles

AsILie:
Think they can hold off both sides?

commie:
one echelon can handle both sides yeah

commie:
the wiki map guide has the moves you need them to make

FlueneCha:
You only need 2 echelons

FlueneCha:
5 turns S clear

FlueneCha:
I followed the guide

commie:
yeah I've been doing that, as well, the guide works pretty well but you'll need a strong enough 2nd echelon to last several fights

commie:
it'll have to deal with 5 battles or so

FlueneCha:
My second is mostly x4

FlueneCha:
And x5 ump45

AsILie:
Think that Wa,SVD,welrod,calico,and grizz can handle it?

FlueneCha:
My boss echelon is the SR3MP one

art12345:
Yea, what i'm doing

Rose ‚ôß:
just not at 0-2

art12345:
You didn't drag at 4-3e?

Rose ‚ôß:
Baby steps

art12345:
With those 2 ars?

FlueneCha:
Is Zas the best grenadier option?

commie:
before finally getting equips and dolls to single DPS do 0-2, I dragged with x4 FNC and FAL on 4-3E, it's pretty doable

Rose ‚ôß:
Some time ago

Rose ‚ôß:
They were x3 link by the time I got to chapter 6

art12345:
Ah

Kitsune:
hey folks

commie:
zas is a subpar grenadier as an actual AR iirc

Rose ‚ôß:
Barely living by

Rose ‚ôß:
This was about 5 months ago

commie:
she has that corpse dragging niche and probably other niches that require large area grenades

FlueneCha:
I have the 3 5* grenadiers

Kitsune:
large area grenades?

Kitsune:
just get sopmod

commie:
I have no idea if there is any need for a grenade that covers almost the entire field

commie:
besides zas dragging

commie:
ü§∑

Kitsune:
memes

commie:
that is a noble goal

FlueneCha:
I have sopmod x5 and 416 x5 too

Sparkee100:
K11 change my mind

Kitsune:
K11's fine

FlueneCha:
I was talking about dragging too

Kitsune:
Zas' niche makes her worthwhile imo

Rose ‚ôß:
I didn't have 416 at the time as well

commie:
future content reeee

Sparkee100:
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

Kitsune:
it's a fantastic way to farm equipment fodder whilst training dolls

commie:
well, as a grenadier dragger she probably doesn't have enough DPS to deal with 0-2

Rose ‚ôß:
I spent way too many contracts rolling HGs in pursuit of calico

Kitsune:
since that map has no exp falloff

commie:
but I dunno, you could level one to 100 and try that out

Sparkee100:
she is super fast too

Sparkee100:
so thats a huge plus

Kitsune:
also

Kitsune:
i use ST AR-15 and M4 SOPMOD for 0-2 dragging

Sparkee100:
üòÆ

commie:
I'm going to give AR-15 a try when I get max gear

Sparkee100:
no g11?

commie:
until then sleepo

Kitsune:
i have g11

Kitsune:
but she's not as good

FlueneCha:
Blk bullet is op

Sparkee100:
wah

Kitsune:
as our lord and savior

Kitsune:
ST AR-15

Sparkee100:
>___>

commie:
are we talking level 100 AR-15?

Kitsune:
level 118

Sparkee100:
ru talkin about AR15 mod

Sparkee100:
ic

commie:
well yeah, I suppose with mod

Kitsune:
want me to record?

Sparkee100:
we EN plebs don't have MOD yet

commie:
^

Sparkee100:
so G11 is base god atm

commie:
:V

Sparkee100:
üòÑ

Kitsune:
i'll record M4 SOP and ST AR-15 dragging in one go

Kitsune:
üëç

Sparkee100:
okie

commie:
is she better than G11 at level 100 max gear though?

Kitsune:
lemme finish my oreos

Sparkee100:
how many runs before m16 repair?

commie:
because well, that's what matters for us now

FlueneCha:
Is SOP MOD too?

Kitsune:
no clue

Kitsune:
never paid attention

Xeal:
You do use fairies right Kit

Kitsune:
yeah

commie:
oof

Sparkee100:
oh ye there is that too

Sparkee100:
XD

Kitsune:
60% chance for 50% crit rate buff

CptHenry:
Are fairies in EN?

commie:
nope

Kitsune:
<:SOPMODfunnyfeic:427804752701554719>

commie:

CptHenry:

commie:

Sparkee100:

Sparkee100:

AsILie:

Not that I know of...

art12345:
Eh nvm

art12345:
They were talking about the skin

Ledah:
Yea they skimmed past my question

art12345:
I mean

commie:
you're not missing on anything tbf

Sparkee100:
login dolls usually come back as drops from events

Siege Waifus:
ah

FlueneCha:
I want 6p62 I missed her

Ledah:
That's a relief... Thanks guys

Rose ‚ôß:
Sparkee, how hard are you right now

Siege Waifus:
I missed everyone up until September, since I only started playing late August

c3:
she was the first monthly doll, then in cube, so now you have to wait for cube+

Sparkee100:
I am just happy

Sparkee100:
:3

art12345:
Eh

art12345:
Is contender really that gud?

Sparkee100:
and feel like finally doing 0-2

art12345:
Maybe late game idk

Sparkee100:
Contender basically enables 5* HG DPS squad

commie:
consider contender late game gear in mmo terms

PotatoTheFirst:
contender's tiles are great

Siege Waifus:
actually Mid August, I missed MT-9 (? don't remember which one is it) for 2 days I think.

Siege Waifus:
no, 6 days

PotatoTheFirst:
and her skill is good vs bosses

FlueneCha:
Also bamboo core

Rose ‚ôß:
contender's tiles makes me very erect

Sparkee100:

art12345:
Well i kinda stopped cheesing bosses

Rose ‚ôß:

art12345:
Tbf tho

commie:
echelons are still worth it though

FlueneCha:
I can only help support wise I bought no dorms

art12345:
At some point you can cheese bosses with your own

Rose ‚ôß:
I cheesed bosses from chapters 3-5

art12345:
Which isn't really cheesing

FlueneCha:
I never used supports for bosses

art12345:
I did it to uhhh

commie:
you'll find friend echelons really useful when you start grinding silver medals

art12345:
I just sicced my friends upon the bosses

Rose ‚ôß:
Saw that I got my asshole ripped in chapter 6

art12345:
And let them do their thing: completely annihilate them

Rose ‚ôß:
took a break, grinded

Rose ‚ôß:
I couldn't corpse drag back then due to lack of ARs that were strong enough to drag

art12345:
But

Rose ‚ôß:
so that was at least 40k ammo gone

art12345:
The AR?

art12345:
The squad didn't exist back then?

Rose ‚ôß:
it was just m4 and ar 15 to drag back then

art12345:
M4, soap, star

art12345:
Well

art12345:
I have m4 and star rite now to drag

art12345:
And am neglecting soap and m16

Rose ‚ôß:
I didn't have fal, g11, or any of the ARs most suited to drag

art12345:
Nawww

art12345:
Look

commie:
drag 4-3E :V

Rose ‚ôß:
^

art12345:
Wdym

Rose ‚ôß:
You can drag with m4 and ar15

FlueneCha:
Type 64 mod3 is badass she looks even better than the skins

CptHenry:
Is Z-62 any better or worse than Skorpion?

FlueneCha:
Better imo

Chiaki:
slightly stronger molotov

FlueneCha:
She has more tiles too

Sheodoq:
Good luck getting dupes to link :p

Chiaki:
it's a 3* tho so it's fine

CptHenry:
She's a random drop right?

Ayeccs:
cube limited drop

Sheodoq:
From Cube

Sheodoq:
So rip

CptHenry:
Oh

FlueneCha:
She will be in HP later

commie:

Sheodoq:
She's at least usable though but yeah rip

James1328:
Whim

James1328:
Are you Grizzly

FlueneCha:
She's the cutest molotov

James1328:
Or Lolizzly

James1328:
<:hkStare2:414084643848192006>

Sheodoq:
Loli

CptHenry:
What other good offensive smgs are there?

Sheodoq:
The bear ears are there

James1328:
Besides shrimp?

James1328:
I dunno

James1328:
Vector

Sheodoq:
Vector and Sr-3MP are top

Chiaki:

CptHenry:
Have those two

James1328:
Whim

CptHenry:
Then there's Skorpion

FlueneCha:
Skorpion is fine

James1328:
Did you saw that cursed image?

Chiaki:
maybe

James1328:
Of lolizzly

James1328:
And the ruler

Chiaki:
yes

Sheodoq:
Skorpion, Z-62, and PPS-43 are good

James1328:
<:umpOwO:500681384226979840>

James1328:
Ayy

FlueneCha:

august99us:

Sheodoq:
Petabytes of hentai

James1328:
Lood august

Chiaki:
pp19 and klin will be our options

FlueneCha:
Honey badger is hot

Sheodoq:
Naturally

commie:
for now at least, we'll get offensive smgs in the future

Chiaki:
despite pps43 nade dealing more damage, pp19 has a 25% damage tile behind her

Shiki:
Cms or bust

James1328:
Cms

James1328:
More like

Sheodoq:

FlueneCha:
Passive evasion multiplier is dank

FlueneCha:
HK21 is my gfl waifu

Sheodoq:
Negev is mine but HK21 is cute

CptHenry:
M14 is my waifu

FlueneCha:
M14 MOD probably reigns as the best rf now

FlueneCha:
She was hyped a lot so I'm assuming she was worth all that

CptHenry:
I mean she's a goddess atm

CptHenry:
And LWMMG is a demi-goddess

CptHenry:
Yeah that it's gonna ship with Sands from Undertale as your secretary because he killed Kalina

Rose ‚ôß:
<@269539595102715904> merely a side project, not gonna replace gfl

Siege Waifus:

CptHenry:
Getting decent exp though

CptHenry:
ü¶ê is 14 levels away from 100

Siege Waifus:
Mine is 12 away

CptHenry:
As long as my doll teams are at least 4 linked, I should be okay on the Elphelt stage, right?

Siege Waifus:
maybe

Luxanna:
batt pvp level easy in 3 minutes

Luxanna:
welp

Luxanna:
I want tokens too

Luxanna:
but at the same time

Luxanna:
I still don't think it's worth it

Luxanna:
I am too low on resources

Luxanna:
also it's been so long since I got a skin

CptHenry:
My last skins were the Halloween ones for Springfield and Type 64

CptHenry:
Is Type 64 Mod 3 any good?

Rose ‚ôß:
we're not getting mod 3 anytime soon

Siege Waifus:
Type 64 is good

James1328:
Yeah

James1328:
She is good

James1328:
Fodder

James1328:
üçΩ

commie:
oof

commie:
she has a skin so it's up to you to make her work :V

Rose ‚ôß:
Anyone can be "decent" with enough investment

Rose ‚ôß:
but there is a limit based on the character

Rggcd:
idw viable

Rose ‚ôß:
let your wood do the work

Rose ‚ôß:
ü§∑

Siege Waifus:
I have 2 skins for her, I think the game is telling me something

Akuma:
Type 64 a cute

Akuma:
level her

Akuma:
<a:ablobreachL:412745930404790282>

Siege Waifus:
she's level 70 already

commie:
she's cute but if there's one thing I'm not lacking is good SMGs

CptHenry:
Hopefully her MOD3 brings her up in terms of usability

Siege Waifus:
what's her mod 3?

HoshiUsagi:
prob same as IDW mod 3

commie:
danya

Luxanna:
Type 64 is so meh

Luxanna:
tbh

Luxanna:
without the skin that is

commie:
she's frankly not terrible

Luxanna:
but imma put her skinned in my chinese siscon echelon

commie:
usable at most but it's not an IDW

Luxanna:
I am not talking about meta

Luxanna:
I am talking about her cuteness

HoshiUsagi:
Kar Mod3

Akuma:
tbh i really liked design of "normal" 64

commie:
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

Akuma:
without skins

Akuma:
<:springTea:427818533431410691>

HoshiUsagi:
the first 5* mod3

HoshiUsagi:
KAR

Luxanna:
wait

Luxanna:
really?

HoshiUsagi:
no

Luxanna:
welp

HoshiUsagi:
not in real life

Luxanna:
why should I care

HoshiUsagi:
despite all the love they claim for Kar

HoshiUsagi:
girl never get a single buff or outfit

commie:


commie:
8)

commie:
wait, she doesn't have any outfits?

HoshiUsagi:
no, artist absent

Luxanna:
yup

c3:
she has a special equip that boosts her crit dmg a little, making her a little bit less awful. that's it

commie:
she's on the icon for the game, what went so wrong?

Luxanna:
she doesn't

Luxanna:


Chiaki:
i'm pretty sure kar artist also did aug

Luxanna:


Chiaki:
and aug is like 4 months old

c3:
>what went so wrong
she was op at the beginning, so they nerfed her into the ground and never looked back

HoshiUsagi:
Devs: Kar is our waifu
>No outfit
>Worst 5*
>literally nonexistent except in waifu echelon

Luxanna:
how do you turn that piece of flat bread in the first pic

Luxanna:
into a boobie monster from the second pic

Luxanna:
HOW

Luxanna:
DO YOU DO THAT

HoshiUsagi:
but you know what?

HoshiUsagi:
she has a secret

HoshiUsagi:
She actually AUG

Luxanna:
I just looked up her special eq

Luxanna:
it's **YIKES**

HoshiUsagi:
when your main role suck, gotta take a part time job

commie:
>waifu echelon
>that's a weird way of spelling "logistics echelon"

Chiaki:
considering she can also equip a cape, it's not that bad, but it's still kar

Luxanna:
I love how little does she care about aiming

Yue:
<:SOPMODfunnyfeic:427804752701554719>

Sen:
OMG

Sen:
SHE JUST NUKED AGAIN

Sen:
JUST AS THE FIGHT STARTED

Sen:
INSTANTLY

suguri:
you need to be in X formation

suguri:
if she starts the fight beloe 50% hp

Sen:
Yeah

ChikenTheBaka:
Rip Sen 2nd group

Sen:
just learnt it the bad way

Sen:
okay, third try

CptHenry:
So do you kill the armored mobs before going into X formation or after?

Sen:
before

CptHenry:
That's tricky

CptHenry:
What if you can't kill them before the nuke goes off?

Cammerhammer:
Nuke shouldn't go off before then

Cammerhammer:
You shouldn't target Elphelt before they are down

Sen:
Ok

Sen:
i give up

Sen:
they just all died

Sen:
she nuked twice in a row

Sen:
with no reason

ChikenTheBaka:
Do you guys know what the furniture will be for the Christmas gacha?

suguri:
the reason is she was low hp

Sen:
before my characters could attack

Sen:
yes but

ChikenTheBaka:
<:thonk9:410657576892497930>

Sen:
BEFORE ANYONE

Sen:
CAN DO ANYTHING

Sen:
It's stupid

Sen:
i have everything in x formation

Sen:
I'm not giving up

Sen:
4th try

Sen:
im recording this shit

commie:
are you moving into an X formation or just setting the echelon on an X formation wasting the buffs?

Sen:
moving

Sen:
but it's not like i had time

Sen:
to move the characters

Sen:
it just opened the combat with the invincibility

Sen:
so i couldn't move

Sen:
then while my characters were moving forward

Sen:
nuked again

nguuuquaaa:
did you MG her?

Yue:
Put them in X formation from the formation menu if you need to redo the fight

Sen:
no

Yue:
There's no time to move them

Sen:
she's dead.

Sen:
it's over.

Sen:
yeah that's what i did

nguuuquaaa:
then you need other thing

nguuuquaaa:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kEs9HedQOA

nguuuquaaa:
MG Elphelt is different from other strat that it actually does too much dmg
so you limit it and voila

commie:
just pause the game 4Head

ChikenTheBaka:
Use rifles <:minkLove:427816604659613707>

Luxanna:
140 batts for free

Luxanna:
is decent indeed

Luxanna:
tommorow is the last day I am going to farm seithrs

ChikenTheBaka:
Why? <:suomiNANI:414084644322017280>

Chiaki:
not exactly free but the rsc you use getting them is meaningless so it's a net gain <:OK:500692128058572800>

Luxanna:
or I might farm them till the end

Luxanna:
while skipping the last battle

c3:
<@!257186738986811392>

Luxanna:
the last one is simply too expensieve

Luxanna:
and it's not worth it

CptHenry:
I have 4 more Elphelt battles to go through

CptHenry:
Sigh

Luxanna:
imagine wasting 2k of rations to get quick repair contracts

Luxanna:
HAHA

nguuuquaaa:
E1-4 has high core drop rate tho

nguuuquaaa:
also tf how do you even need 2k rations

Luxanna:
idk

Luxanna:
it's more like

Luxanna:
600 - 1k rations

Luxanna:
still not worth it

Luxanna:
if you want cores just go and hobo run 0 2

Luxanna:
I believe that e-4 has much higher core drop rate

Luxanna:
but at the same time a single run is like 10x as expensieve

Luxanna:
so yeah, there's that

Draconex:
and even if it's incredible niche they still take a whole lotta rsc

Draconex:
<:M4A1Spray:414084482283601921>

PKP and MG5

commie:

Draconex:
I got pkp too LUL

Veiss_:
PKP and MG5

Frey:
i wouldnt have what i have know

Frey:
i would have 0 res

Frey:

Sheodoq:
Negev is just good for those stubborn bosses

Draconex:
R I P

Veiss_:
that's all Negev is amazing at

Frey:
i have almost every 5 stars only missing a few of other classes and ALL OF FOCKING MG

Frey:
but i am calm

Frey:
i am cool about it

Frey:
my day will come

Sheodoq:
I'm only missing PK and SAT8 for my MGSG collection

Veiss_:
considering her skill isn't very effective at the point you're ending most engagements in several seconds

Sheodoq:
I just want M99 for my loli collection

Veiss_:
***oh.***

Frey:
i have one

Sheodoq:
:c

Frey:
i want her new set of clothes

Frey:
makes me sound less tribal this way

Sheodoq:
is this one where she calls the police when damaged?

Sheodoq:
this the one*

Frey:
oh yeah

Frey:
i had that problem first day

Sheodoq:
ah I want it to then

Frey:
FBI was on her quick access on her phone

Draconex:
110

Draconex:
Police incoming

Frey:
LEarn that the hardway

Sheodoq:
god I need to do my armored enemies weekly

Frey:
It was probably that

Frey:
but armored enemies are boring

Sheodoq:
free resources are always welcome

Frey:
Ah a man of knowledge

Sheodoq:
I used to play a lot of MMOs so autistic grinding is normal to me

Veiss_:
great feeling when you reach for your phone and it's cold

Frey:
Well i also have that

Frey:
But grind without a purpose

Frey:
is <:karlicious:414085222217416705>

Sheodoq:
eh it's not bad at all compared to some games

Frey:
maybe the wrong emote but oh well

Frey:
Well but are those weekly challenges worth it?

Frey:
I mean i only finish that 200 normal enemies because its a side effect of 0-2

Sheodoq:
with the way I do it I spend like 100 manpower and 5 rations for 1000 man, 2000 ammo/rations, 600 parts or something

Sheodoq:
worth it imo

Sheodoq:
just throw a hg in the arena and summon a friend echelon

Sheodoq:
spam end turn until mission fail

Sheodoq:
I just watch a stream while doing it

Sheodoq:
needs even less attention than 0-2 as you just need to press one button until mission end

Frey:
hm

Sheodoq:
besides I mostly do 7-2e as I need cores

Sheodoq:
I have like 400 runs of 0-2 at lvl 116 lol

Frey:
well

Frey:
i have around 80 runs 0-2 and iam lvl 80

Sheodoq:
I only do 0-2 because it's more xp efficient

Sheodoq:
and also because 7-2e didn't exist for most of the time I played :p

august99us:

There might be but he's prolly lurking

Frey:
<:umpOwO:500681384226979840> üó°

c3:
there is

Kid:
there is

Ruzike:
I spot with my little eye.

A gfl manga

Draconex:
My brain is shutting down why am i still studying at 4am

Draconex:
<:M4A1depression:410654965892382721>

art12345:
Hmm

art12345:
Here is a weird question:

Ruzike:
Answer

art12345:
If u were a t-doll, which would you be most likely

Frey:
there is? <:hkStare2:414084643848192006>

art12345:
Like who has your personality the most, maybe looks can be a factor

Ruzike:
Sop 2

Frey:
So let me ask you this in return: Would you become someone you loved irl also?

art12345:
Ur a sadist ruz?

c3:
looks of a doll could be changed as necessary and personality is just a matter of programming

art12345:
Well

Ruzike:
<:karlicious:414085222217416705>

c3:
pointless rp threat

art12345:
At least currently in the game

art12345:
Ok

Sheodoq:
remember to farm Elphelt for those loot boxes

Frey:
eh

Ruzike:
<:M4A1Spray:414084482283601921>

Sheodoq:
:c

art12345:
Do seithyrs even give much

Chiaki:
half an hour of dailies <:OK:500692128058572800>

Frey:
but i think soppo would fit me nicely

art12345:
Once u r high leveled

Sheodoq:
anything for cores

Frabjous:
<a:homePop:484729428275101696>

Chiaki:
they're worth it

Sheodoq:
I'll suck dick for cores

FlueneCha:
Tokens batteries everything

Sheodoq:
I just use 5 hg teams so the runs are cheap

art12345:
Cores, battery, training data, capsules

FlueneCha:
Data too

Chiaki:
quick training tickets

Ruzike:
<:hkStare2:414084643848192006>

Frey:
wait

Frey:
you said pills?

FlueneCha:
Yeah

Frey:
those usless pills?

Sheodoq:
only the finest drugs for my t-dolls

art12345:
Pills r garbage

art12345:
Don't do drugs kids

art12345:
Unless u r a robot

FlueneCha:
Drug ur t dolls so they become stronk

Frey:
Drugs (chems) working on robots

art12345:
Drugs can't hurt u if u don't have an actual meatbag system

Frey:
i see

Frey:
makes sense

art12345:
So u can do all the crack u want

FlueneCha:
Maybe you too will have the privilege of getting ur hands on buff MP5

art12345:
If u r a full on robot

art12345:
And not a cyborg

Frey:
Hm

Sheodoq:
I hope one day I'll get a M99 :c

Veiss_:
lol just hold Mica at gunpoint

Veiss_:
and their families

Sheodoq:
:p

Veiss_:
don't actually do that

Frey:
i hope i someday can get a 5* MG

Frey:
just one

Sheodoq:
just do what I did

Sheodoq:
and roll MGs since open beta

Draconex:
....

Sheodoq:
worked eventually

Draconex:
Heh

Draconex:
Negev first roll

Draconex:
<:mk48LUL:500681251733110785>

Veiss_:
negev niche

Sheodoq:
WA2000 was mine

art12345:
are 5 star mg really that rare?

Sheodoq:
good ones are

Sheodoq:
for some reason MG4 likes to drop in

commie:
it's more because the MG recipe overlaps with other stuff

Veiss_:
there's only like 2 great MGs in the 5 star list

art12345:
to make it not boring

commie:
save tokens for gooder gachi :V

art12345:
ugly, yes

art12345:
but i just want to see comfort go up

c3:
honestly, if you think that reports are a good way to level, you may as well spend that cash on energy and do xp sim runs, since you only get reports when you grind anyway to get surplus xp

Xeal:
No, furniture sets does not get rerun alongside future skins later. They just get added to the Radiant Collection.

commie:
mobage is all about self control

commie:
not spending 70 contracts on HG recipe like I did :V

Pungey:
OhISee

FlueneCha:
Gfl is about ragecrafting

FlueneCha:
That is how I got 70%of the stuff I have

c3:
rage crafting and rate ups

c3:
it's true

FlueneCha:
Sacrifice your resources for the greater good

Rose ‚ôß:
Can confirm rage crafting is 80% of gfl gameplay

LoneWalker:
>not just getting all of the new tdolls within 10 rolls
üòé

art12345:
7.2k comfort

art12345:

art12345:

Kid:

commie:

commie:

Kid:

Kid:

commie:

suguri:
in terms of likeliness m2 is probably the first one of the big 4 to get a mod

suguri:
actually if blue's rumor is true

suguri:
she'll be the only candidate

Chiaki:
the fact that ma deuce doesn't have a skin makes me skeptical

Frey:
Is there a manga of girls frontline?

Frey:
official

Nihilo:
There is two.

Nihilo:
CN is the true adaption.

Nihilo:
JP‚Äôs doing some odd end omake anthology.

One‚Äôs for authentic story, other is just for random SOL/humor.

None of her future skins are animated. FYI.

suguri:

1000 comfort is 1 battery, so 3000 comfort for 3000exp

It's a good feeling, going "Haw haw haw, I wonder if I should turn my 3 FALs into one or end up with 4 total FALs!"

CptHenry:
Is the advanced training sim worth doing if you have to do it with two echelons?

Kitsune:
which sim

Kitsune:
exp?

Kitsune:
personally i view it as a waste of sim points, but you guys don't have any other options rn

Chiaki:
that's 24k exp for all 10 members

Rose ‚ôß:
exp sim is a filler when there is no other sim available besides defense drill

CptHenry:
Isn't it good for filling out combat reports?

Siege Waifus:
you also gain a lot of surplus exp, for combat reports, so it's not just filler

Rose ‚ôß:
0-2 already does the job of filling out surplus exp

Siege Waifus:
if you don't have max level dolls, exp sim is good or better for that

suguri:
I wake up and see tactical bowtie

Siege Waifus:
but anyways, you don't have to repair, you don't lose resources, you also don't gain dolls or equipment, but it's free exp

Rose ‚ôß:
or just do 0-2 and still end up with the same results

Rose ‚ôß:
one is faster than the other, however

(¬¥„Éªœâ„Éª`) Y U e L:
GADDAMN IT, 1 ENEMY LEFT

Siege Waifus:
intermediate exp sim is far easier than doing 0-2 if your echelon isn't quite a good

Rose ‚ôß:
depends on the person then

Rose ‚ôß:
and their echelons

suguri:
hope it moves left

suguri:
oh

Siege Waifus:
yeah, I hate when you run out of turns and the last enemy just moves away from you

(¬¥„Éªœâ„Éª`) Y U e L:
It moved already

it uploaded in the wrong order

Rievakins:
no need for iws prolly

c3:
she's rarer, but one that you will eventually come across for sure, not a unicorn

Rievakins:
question will purp carcanos replace iws?

Rievakins:
basically max out her rof?

c3:
they have different usage cases

Rievakins:
purp is for armored only?

Nihilo:
She‚Äôs meant to merc high end mobs.

Nihilo:
Manticores for example.

WhiteKnight:
Purple kills one mob super dead

Rievakins:
whats merc?

Nihilo:
Merc > kill.

WhiteKnight:
IWS mows down scores of big guys but not hundreds of tiny guys

Rievakins:
I know that her ability procs her passive. But how fast does she proc it by rof?

Rievakins:
I though purp was made as an answer to the devs making latter content too hard.

Nihilo:
Not really, she can make it easier.

Nihilo:
Doesn‚Äôt mean there aren‚Äôt any other options to use to play said content.

<:RibBleeding:415391866822066176>

Rievakins:
Are like 200k manticores part of the latter chapters?

c3:
the occasion where we'd need a ppk emote

Nihilo:
Later on.

Pungey:
Im guessing its an optional node

Rievakins:
like story chapters?

Pungey:
That you are supposed to avoid engaging

Nihilo:
About half of that. But still dangerous If you expected a cozy little lark, you‚Äôre in the wrong job.

Nihilo:
For later story maps.

Nihilo:
You‚Äôre shat on in story, and in gameplay opposition.

Nihilo:
<:OK:500692128058572800>

Nihilo:
And that‚Äôs just the one faction.

Nihilo:
Should see the new guys.

Pungey:
We already have 2 new factions outside of SF

Pungey:
3 if you count them zeds

Rievakins:
so you're saying latter missions are only for players who've played so long that they can pass it while newer players accept the fact that they aren't gonna complete it until they've played long enough?

WhiteKnight:
I can't wait to catch up to CN in like ten years

Nihilo:
Relax, you got so many alternatives to the power grind.

Nihilo:
EXP Sims, Reports.

Nihilo:
This is a far cry of what the older servers were like.

Nihilo:
Bare bones.

Nihilo:
By the clock.

Pungey:
New player experience isnt too bad outside of HOXY

Rievakins:
so kinda like dark souls or similar?

WhiteKnight:
IIRC CN didn't even have equipment until CUBE

Rievakins:
yeah no hoxy.

Rievakins:
cri

Nihilo:
Sure, like Dark Souls.

Nihilo:
Actually the Head Dev did mention how difficulty would be like that.

Nihilo:
For future stuff.

Nihilo:
<:fncFat:502098769379196928>

ChikenTheBaka:
Hoxy? <:hoxyShock:484732324072914964>

Rievakins:
well I did started off playing this game without any help nor understanding.

Sparkee100:

FlueneCha:
<:SOPMODfunnyfeic:427804752701554719>

Sparkee100:
I am gonna use reaper ult on all u Luccsaccs

Sparkee100:
Ahhhhhhhh

Nihilo:
So in other words, your luck sucks.

Sparkee100:
<:roCry:414084703323160576>

Nihilo:
Hence why you can‚Äôt post trophies of your own.

Nihilo:
<:umpOwO:500681384226979840>

commie:
>hmm I've got my ARs at level 50 I probably can't finish the event

c3:
üî•

FlueneCha:
I got her second after talking about her

commie:
dunno but that doesn't seem like a friendly way to respond to something

FlueneCha:
*seconds

Sparkee100:
Last time I got something for trophy was umm iws release

Sparkee100:
That's a long time ago

Sparkee100:
üò≠

Nihilo:
If you want to use her, Chi-Cha, you can use her for Boss Killing Squads.

Nihilo:
Contender that is.

Nihilo:
She does work well enough in a 5HG build.

Nihilo:
Supporting CZ75.

Nihilo:
She‚Äôs ain‚Äôt a main line Nuker.

Nihilo:
So don‚Äôt treat her like one.

Nihilo:
She‚Äôs a support specialist at most.

FlueneCha:
Someone talked about someone else running 5hg and I said I saw someone using CZ75 on Elphelt no one forced or told you to use then

FlueneCha:
*them

Sparkee100:
She is a must have for DPS HG squad :3

SleepyDuck:
Is it

SleepyDuck:
bulli jay time

SleepyDuck:
<@!307921946945781761>  are u woke

FlueneCha:
I was thinking of probably running Bamboo Squad since I have all 4 of the RFs

SleepyDuck:
should i train Mk48?

Sparkee100:
Yes

FlueneCha:
Use her

FlueneCha:
Yee

Nihilo:
Depends on the Bamboo.

Sparkee100:
Mk48 is <:mk48LUL:500681251733110785>

commie:
mk48 is a hunting impulse MG

commie:
I mean sure, if you need an MG

FlueneCha:
I have Spring at x5 so probably Small first I just miss Mosin's equip and she's level 70

Nihilo:
If you got the AP for Springfield it‚Äôs fine.

FlueneCha:
Yes

Nihilo:
Mosin‚Äôs more of a late bloomer.

Sparkee100:
Springfield exodia ;3

FlueneCha:
I have spring's equip

FlueneCha:
Mk48 is my 2nd favorite MG

Rievakins:

I rejoined it yesterday

commie:
you should have, about one and a half week to go

commie:
level a bit more and you should be able to do elphelt 6 times

commie:
you only need to clear to get her

Lilya Starikova:
JUST DO it while you can

AnGeRy DuCk:
I mean the blonde girl

FlueneCha:
It's AOK if you get Elphelt

SleepyDuck:
ragecrafting

AnGeRy DuCk:
I won't get her

Lilya Starikova:

SleepyDuck:
FUCK OFF VAL

SleepyDuck:

FlueneCha:
Vol

AnGeRy DuCk:
AS Val irl is good

FlueneCha:
I didn't try using a bamboo squad cause none of my RFs are done but I could try I guess just for funs

FlueneCha:
My Springfield is x5 sl8 and my NTW is only x3 I think

Lilya Starikova:
wait

Sparkee100:
Should be doable

FlueneCha:
I also have spring ammo

Lilya Starikova:
is calibration and battery ticket for 118 gems worth it or nah

Lilya Starikova:
like 200 calibration and battery

FlueneCha:
Eh..

FlueneCha:
Nah

Sparkee100:
Ye if you whale

c3:
I tried bamboo at the very start just for giggles and found it not worth it

Lilya Starikova:
i have 450 gems sitting here

commie:
probably not unless you have some immediate priority you need the batteries and calib tickets for

FlueneCha:
You can stock up on both without being that hard

c3:
Now I'm lazy and just send 3rf on her ass, which kill her before she even gets to use her skill

Sparkee100:
It's the calibration ticket that is worth for whales

Lilya Starikova:
<@!195260277619556358>  someone is bugging me to get Iws rib

FlueneCha:
Both of my bamboos have underleveled partners so...

Siege Waifus:
calibration tickets are always worth it

FlueneCha:
My spring is the only x5 one

Lilya Starikova:
the 580 is disappointment

Lilya Starikova:
NO OATH RING

Siege Waifus:
oof

c3:
<@!333624167280934912> I'll see to that later then

Siege Waifus:
well, it's 100 tokens

FlueneCha:
M99 is untouched and Mosin is like level  60 or 70

Sparkee100:
What's ur handguns

Lilya Starikova:
im going to put JS05 into good use

commie:
cheaper 100 token package with a lot of data

commie:
if you need data and have the spare gems, eh

commie:
it's cheaper than straight up buying the tokens for the christmas gachi

FlueneCha:
I can run strong FP hgs from my other squads but I'm missing the core hg

Sparkee100:
What do u have ATM?

FlueneCha:
I am Contenderlet

c3:
meh, in the roadmap they announced they will have special sales, so I'd maybe hold out for that

Sparkee100:
U don't need contender for the rifle squad

FlueneCha:
I have the full Bamboo set expect contender

Sparkee100:
U need basically grizzly, calico, welrod

Lilya Starikova:
unless yer a gopnik like me

FlueneCha:
Eh.. I already run my wavd like that

Lilya Starikova:
who goes mad man on RF build

Sparkee100:
Cuz u kill elphelt before any of your tdoll skill activves

Sparkee100:
Wait u have WASVD?

Sparkee100:
Then u can do easy S on elphelt

Lilya Starikova:
my RF Squad is basically

FlueneCha:
I do S with SR3MP I just wanted to bamboo

it went from gameplay discussion to flexing, rip main room

Lilya Starikova:
who is the fleccs police tho

FlueneCha:
Sure

commie:
no idea, and I assume it's a loosely enforced rule

commie:
trophy room probably exists so main room doesn't get oversaturated with screenshots

Pacbough:
they just don't want too much spam going on in mainroom

commie:
on the other hand flexing makes you look like an asshole but eh, people don't care about that, do they?

Sparkee100:

Tsurupettan:
Is your dorm decked out in 4 star sets?

Gal:
Am I supposed to do 4-3e runs until I get the equipment required for 0-2 right?

commie:
you can do 0-2 full resupply runs

commie:
you might need often repairs

commie:
if you're thinking about corpse dragging then yes, you really need gold equips with good rolls to move from 4-3E to 0-2

commie:
as well as strong DPS dolls

Askar:
Do u need to max gold equips as well

commie:
not necessarily, +6 max calibrated equipment should work

commie:
ofc having it at +10 is better but you only need the regular mobs (non-jaegers) to deal 1 damage per hit

commie:
and that requires a +6 or +7 gold plate

commie:
having a highly enhanced exo is important though, since the main reason you want to use M16 over SGs to tank is because of her evasion

commie:
and if you want to run with a single DPS, you better have those gold equips

AlliedG üá¨üáß:
If you have grizzly you can buff m16 evasion as well

commie:
more ap ammo 8)

Vinen:
<:BlobTentacles:414069204963164160>

Saitama:
<@234148712631238656> Optimal dragging is to bring M16 (With level 8 Gold Armor and a +10 Gold T-Exo), G11 with +10 HV and VFL, then whoever else.

Saitama:
If you're going speed, level your HG dolls alongside them.

Saitama:
Since those tile buffs are active even if they don't have rations/ammo.

Saitama:
Otherwsie, bring whoever else you want to level.

Pacbough:
For 0-2 G11 > FAL > SOPMOD II > 416

Saitama:
Just don't keep anyone in position 8.

Saitama:
^

Saitama:
Debatable on that nades though.

Saitama:
SOPMOD "can" be the fastest, but only if the AI decides to not be dumb and lob her nade at the far end.

Saitama:
If it's the center, Soppu has the fastest clears of the nades.

Saitama:
But in the end

Pacbough:
that's why FAL is more reliable with 3 nades

Saitama:
FAL is defiantly the most reliable clear time of the naders.

Saitama:
Uh

Saitama:
Definitely

Saitama:
There we go.

It should use Canadian currency. But its weird that it would show it in USD until today.

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
no GFL convention over here

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
anime games are considered hentai no matter what

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
<:roCry:414084703323160576>

somerandom101person:
At least one of our anime convention is selling keychain-like GFL..

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
I once played GFL in public

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
no sound

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
kids saw it and called it "games for girls"

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
<:RibBleeding:415391866822066176>

StrayedPath:
They'll find out

StrayedPath:
soon

Pungey:
<:mk48LUL:500681251733110785>

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
"mommy, that uncle is playing a game filled with girls, is he gay?"

Sehai-Kun:
Someone say GFL keychains? üëÄ

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
if only I could shoot that kid

Pungey:
Go to US

Sehai-Kun:
But oof. Games for girls. üí¶

The Laughing Man:
<:hkStare2:414084643848192006> These need to go in trophy room

The Laughing Man:
I'm getting salty

Pungey:
I find the part about being called uncle more offensive tbh

Pungey:
<:roCry:414084703323160576>

Sehai-Kun:
I got one more item for GFL today. But it's uhhh.... a little big for me to take a picture rn.

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
<:roCry:414084703323160576>

Sehai-Kun:
I do have this though

Ceia:
did you buy that suomi wallet in the con

some idiot bought that

Sehai-Kun:
But all my vector stuff sold out. <:roCry:414084703323160576>

fun fact

Ceia:
5-7 stand got sold out in 5 minutes

should've went a bit earlier but hey

salty emp:
to miss all vector stuff

Kitsune:
<:g36Lazy:481469060589027329>

Sehai-Kun:
<:roCry:414084703323160576>

vector got sold out in first 20min

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
if I can't get hoxy ingame, I'll get hoxy IRL

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
<:mk48LUL:500681251733110785>

sad

Pungey:
*"Even Ceia is afraid!!"*

Ceia:
i found that store in first 90min

Kitsune:
hopefully i can find something nice

Ceia:
most of their shit are sold

Sehai-Kun:
If vector so popular then why not enough fanart of her? üò†

Ceia:
and i went on day 1 mind you

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
is it official?

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
or fanmade?

The Laughing Man:
<:BlobReach:414069175934386177> Get me something too

yes they're official

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
damn

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
<:thonk9:410657576892497930>

CptHenry:
Yes, I'm weird I know

CptHenry:
Idk, it's hard to explain

Ayeccs:
I understand

Ayeccs:
It's like choosing to stay with 1 of 2 identical twins

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
I oathed 45

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
use 2 dupes of her

Ayeccs:
you want both but can only stay with 1

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
in 2 echelons

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
I don't feel a thing

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
since 45 is irreplaceable

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
her buff is one of a kind

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
good tile coverage too

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
if she's good, I use her

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
if she's the best at what she does

CptHenry:
Like, I want each team to be unique with it's own characters so putting Welrod in two places feels odd to me

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
all the more reason

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
one single T-doll doesn't make it the same

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
even more if it's a tank

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
the dps makes the difference

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
not the tank

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
I use welrod in 3 teams

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
but they are all different

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
1 RoF 1 FP 1 bamboo

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
can't say they are the same <:thonk9:410657576892497930>

august99us:
i think it's a fine reason

august99us:
<:homeThonk:484732324198744097>

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
it's up to the players

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
I still suggest using the best option

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
instead of using an inferior replacement

Ayeccs:
maximum  e s p o r t s

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
because for the long terms it'll only affect you

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
the contents are still easy

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
so using replacements won't change much

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
but when the hard stuffs hit

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
<:RibBleeding:415391866822066176>

[EyoN]:
To use or not to use dupes is all about faith TBH

salty emp:
you come here for aduhhhvaisu you should expect esports 
I don't care if you don't follow muh advice

salty emp:
<:ump40Ehe:414074434035515392>

Ashina:
I duped dolls that have costumes

Strela:
Should tag the guide with no dupegamer allowed <:GudaCano:427805886757601280>

uncaged (nick):
So if I disassemble a 5 star to get 15 cores, I can just recover them later on for the same amount?

uncaged (nick):
Or is there a downside to it?

HazardousJay:
akshually

HazardousJay:
you only get 5 cores

HazardousJay:
from scrapping a 5*

uncaged (nick):
Oh I'm dumb nvm

HazardousJay:
but yeah, if you wanna recover em, thats 15 cores

uncaged (nick):
Doesn't sound too bad

uncaged (nick):
But probably better to keep

deadlymessenger:
you aren't getting back the lost XP though

HazardousJay:
^

HazardousJay:
gonna start from level 1 lel

HazardousJay:
so rip if you scrapped say, a level 90 5* doll by accident

Sparkee100:
>_>

Sparkee100:
just lock em

CptHenry:
Oof

CptHenry:
Yeh

august99us:
just do it anyway

august99us:
not like you have any other content to be doing in this game <:homeThonk:484732324198744097>

animerelatedlover:
Kar is so useless!!

animerelatedlover:
I cant find a way to make her useful!!!

animerelatedlover:
AAAAAAAAAAAH

AsILie:
F

animerelatedlover:
i wasted my effort and time for this illya rip off

CptHenry:
If a 2* that wasn't very good in the first place gets a MOD 3, do stay bad/mediocre or can they shoot up to become top tier characters?

deadlymessenger:
o_o) I've had great time using Kar98k to kill Manticores

AsILie:
Finally xp sim day

animerelatedlover:
I may be doing something wrong

AsILie:
Gonna refill my surplus and grind out my 2 teams from 10 to 50~

deadlymessenger:
some 2 stars stay as still meh, some get more than a leg up

AsILie:
Just so they can stand up to the mobs in E4

CptHenry:
I know LWMMG is gonna be pretty good

animerelatedlover:
Lwmmg is god

AsILie:
I assume IDW stays meh

animerelatedlover:
Among 2 stars shes really good

AsILie:
Even though i love her

CptHenry:
I feel like G43 is gonna be meh

einzele:
idw is not that bad tbh

AsILie:
IDW is fuckin adorable

CptHenry:
Not the best but she's decsnt

CptHenry:
DA NYAAAAAAAAAAAAa

AsILie:
I think the da nya has gotten to me <:g36Lazy:481469060589027329>

CptHenry:
Meh

AsILie:
Am i sick?

AsILie:
Do i need to be punished for like idw?

CptHenry:
As long as you dont fuck actual cats no

AsILie:
~~L85 is also cute even though i want her to go away~~

einzele:
but no, id rather not spending my effort leveling some mediocre 2* dolls for mod

animerelatedlover:
Dear lord... So kar is going to stay as a small fry killer

Draconex:


Draconex:
<:SOPMODfunnyfeic:427804752701554719>

animerelatedlover:
Kar might never face a boss ever again

CptHenry:
I think VM59 is very cute

animerelatedlover:
She will stay crappy for the rest of time. ~~unless they mod her~~

Strela:
Have you guys ever looked at the maps and wondered why the hell you moved there? <:homeThonk:484732324198744097>

CptHenry:
When I was starting out yes

Strela:
Like in e4, there's a roundabout way through the forest, then you stop on the open field, then backstab whatever SF units on the north of the forest

Strela:
Why can't you just attack from the forest?

Strela:
<:hkStare2:414084643848192006>

animerelatedlover:
Why did i even level her

Sparkee100:
ppl gonna vote for Kar

animerelatedlover:
??

Sparkee100:
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

Sparkee100:
inb4 she gets highest vote

august99us:
can we vote for g11

Strela:
Mfw box I've openened are only 15

Strela:
<:hkStare2:414084643848192006>

animerelatedlover:
She's a fucking levl 94 with skill level 8

animerelatedlover:
And shes terrible

animerelatedlover:
<:SOPMODfunnyfeic:427804752701554719>

CptHenry:
Well, yeah

Ayeccs:
true dedication

CptHenry:
She has a nuke

Stillman61:
Bamboo stick is better

animerelatedlover:
Dear lord

CptHenry:
Which just cripples her overall dps

animerelatedlover:
Why did i fucking level her

animerelatedlover:
<:roCry:414084703323160576>

CptHenry:
Meanwhile the war goddess exists

animerelatedlover:
I leveled m14

CptHenry:
Oh, good

animerelatedlover:
Ofc i'd level her

animerelatedlover:
Who wouldnt level her?

H-SÃ∂eÃ∂nÃ∂pÃ∂aÃ∂iÃ∂:
Browsing some manga to read and i swa this

H-SÃ∂eÃ∂nÃ∂pÃ∂aÃ∂iÃ∂:


CptHenry:
One would have to be a fool, or just misinformed

CptHenry:
Meanwhile I need SVD so that Wawa can have a buddy

animerelatedlover:
Anyway... I dunno what should I do with kar?

august99us:
drop her?

animerelatedlover:
Shes so terrible

Stillman61:
Go all the way bud

Ayeccs:
set as part of support

c3:
it's been on imgur for almost a week now https://imgur.com/a/3XTHQgg

CptHenry:
Just set Kar aside and wait 5 years for a Mod 3

august99us:
she has some niche use

august99us:
later

animerelatedlover:
I could go with karxodia setup

august99us:
apparently

animerelatedlover:
Since i dont have iws

c3:
she actually has a special equip with which she isn't completely awful

animerelatedlover:
Hrmmm

animerelatedlover:
This is terrible

animerelatedlover:
I have to wait for that eqp

c3:
singularity it is

CptHenry:
What hg's should I pair with SVD an WA2K?

CptHenry:
I already have Welrod, Grizz, and Calico on another team

august99us:
calico grizzly wlrod

Stillman61:
the best ones

CptHenry:
LOL

august99us:
well

august99us:
get another calico grizzly welrod

august99us:
<:homeThonk:484732324198744097>

CptHenry:
Aww fuk m8

Slave to the Caffeine:
the best is bamboo metal gear

CptHenry:
Not Contender or Stech?

Ayeccs:
stech is good

Ayeccs:
I use her with ppk in fp rifle team

august99us:
stench is prob fine

CptHenry:
The other 3 HG's are in my Lee-14 team

august99us:
stench welrod grizzly

CptHenry:
No Contender?

Sparkee100:
huntin for contender

Sparkee100:
got 2 calico 2 welrod 2 stech

august99us:
contender is not that good unless against something with high health

CptHenry:
AAh

august99us:
or some other situations

CptHenry:
I was gonna use my spare Welrods for dummy linking

CptHenry:
Shite

august99us:
i don't think she replaces standard fp buff hgs

august99us:
you should never use ur spare welrods for dummy linking

august99us:
üò°

CptHenry:
But why

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
but....but...

august99us:
because welrod the most useful girl in the game

august99us:
<:SOPMODfunnyfeic:427804752701554719>

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
I used dupe welrod for dummy linking

CptHenry:
Sigh

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
cuz she's the 4th one

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
<:SOPMODfunnyfeic:427804752701554719>

CptHenry:
I'll leave one or two out of the dummy linking process

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
already had 3 dupes at lvl 100

CptHenry:
I have 5 Welrods

CptHenry:
6 if you count the main one that I ringed

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
question is

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
how many dupes do you use

CptHenry:
I'll leave 1 out of the equation

CptHenry:
I'll use the other 4

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
3 should be ok

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
<:thonk9:410657576892497930>

CptHenry:
Don't have another Griz though

CptHenry:
Also I dislike moving Calico and Welrod every battle

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
you don't have to

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
if enemies are weak

CptHenry:
I guess you could use Makarov as a replacement for Welrod

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
only move if they are stronk

august99us:
why would you use makarov as a replacement when you have 6 welrods <:homeThonk:484732324198744097>

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
same question

CptHenry:
Idk, for some reason the idea of using the same character in another echelon takes the magic out of having oathed her

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
settling for a replacement for that kind of reason

Tom Brady:
<:roCry:414084703323160576>

Actias Luna:
But I wouldn't advise using SGMG against any of the bosses from chapters 1-7 we have right now.

Slave to the Caffeine:
well

Slave to the Caffeine:
Sat8 kinda laughs at al;chemist iirc

Reaper:
hmm

Reaper:
why not xD

Tom Brady:
All the Alchemists?

Slave to the Caffeine:
lots of high dfamage easy to evade bosses right now

Tom Brady:
<a:umptastic:474508554607525898>

Reaper:
ooo

Reaper:
i get ya

HazardousJay:
MG SG can "kinda" work against elphelt

Actias Luna:
Typically speaking, armor is very strong against a lot of increments of small damage. Bosses tend to have a *lot* of damage, and so they melt.

HazardousJay:
but you gotta change formation to X before fighting her, not during the fight

Slave to the Caffeine:
even in CN evasion tanks are the go to thing so

Slave to the Caffeine:
this is why ump45 is "Tank goddess"

deadlymessenger:
the idea is to have a balance

deadlymessenger:
not on the extreme end of the spectrum like IDW or FMG

Slave to the Caffeine:
yeah

Slave to the Caffeine:
ump45 has really good evade and high hp

Slave to the Caffeine:
a good balance of these two makes for a good main tank smg

Actias Luna:
UMP45's evade is acceptable. Not high.

Reaper:
ty for advice doe

CptHenry:
Her skill makes her a good tank

deadlymessenger:
forcefield SMGs (Thompson, G36C) continue to see uses against boss battles or annoying super minions

Actias Luna:
I still do not have a high opinion of her.

Slave to the Caffeine:
her evasion is still pretty high though theres not many smgs higher

Tom Brady:
thing about ump45

CptHenry:
It's between her and RO for good SMG tanks

Tom Brady:
She ends the raid faster

Tom Brady:
pure dmg tiles

Actias Luna:
She's good for offensive support with enough tankiness and utility to be acceptable.

Tom Brady:
ending the fight quicker

Slave to the Caffeine:
yeah her bukk tiles are rediculous

Actias Luna:
But I don't consider her a genuine tank.

Slave to the Caffeine:
i mean

Tom Brady:
Faster you end the fight

Slave to the Caffeine:
CN considers her the goto #1 smg tank

Tom Brady:
less dmg taking

Tom Brady:
= better tank

Slave to the Caffeine:
even more so with her mod3

Actias Luna:
That would be like saying 5 MGs have the potential to be the tankiest of all. :p

Actias Luna:
Which is true, because they can kill before the enemy hits them.

Tom Brady:
M2HB can Body fodder tank

Actias Luna:
But I would rather a line be drawn between survivability through offense and survivability through defense.

Shiki:
Ump45 is there for the tilebuff

Tom Brady:
top 5 highest hp

Slave to the Caffeine:
tile buff and high evasion with good hp

Lilya Starikova:
well why not combine 9 and 45

Slave to the Caffeine:
cause you dont need 2 main tanks

Lilya Starikova:
well i usually eh

Lilya Starikova:
i ran out of SMG's back then sooo

Lilya Starikova:
=w =

CptHenry:
Flashbangs are...meh

Slave to the Caffeine:
i currently run the following

Slave to the Caffeine:


CptHenry:
I run 45 in my ü¶ê echelon

CptHenry:
RO in the Sort-of AR Team echelon

Slave to the Caffeine:
ehh i have bad opinions on shrimp

CptHenry:
She was my first 5*

Slave to the Caffeine:
oh well then

niconeko:
shrimp is cute

august99us:
where's my g11 :beer16:

CptHenry:
She's needy but she does well in the situations I put her in

c3:
*reee in the distance*

CptHenry:
I stay away from armored enemies though

august99us:
with shrimp?

Lilya Starikova:
o

Lilya Starikova:
they removed beer16

CptHenry:
Yeah because my second echelon is better at killing armor

Lilya Starikova:
<:roCry:414084703323160576>

august99us:
shrimp rekts armor o-o

Sparkee100:
where my floof at?

Sparkee100:

Reaper:

CptHenry:
Is a 2 MG/2 HG/ 1 SG Echelon a dumb idea?

Reaper:
they wont get buffs qNQ

Actias Luna:
No, that's rather common, Henry.

Slave to the Caffeine:
an argument can be made for contender also in a 1hg 1sg squad

Reaper:
contender aye?

Reaper:
i just got one of those

Reaper:
is it good?

Slave to the Caffeine:
very

Reaper:
liek MK23 is beastly not complaing but i wanna what sthe best one * ^*

Reaper:
and i see

Actias Luna:
I want to mention, though, that Contender's tiles are weaker than Mk23's in terms of expected DPS gains.

Reaper:
hmm

Reaper:
what makes contender good tho

Reaper:
is it the AP rounds?

Slave to the Caffeine:
her skill

Actias Luna:
+crit chance currently won't give amazing returns.

Reaper:
oo

20thSentryFox:
contender is great forcannon squad

Sparkee100:
57? what

Slave to the Caffeine:
her skill makes them focus fire on boss with 30% additional damage

Slave to the Caffeine:
truning them into boss killing machines

Reaper:
wow that buff range

Slave to the Caffeine:
yeah

Reaper:
so should i use Contender over MK23?

20thSentryFox:
why not use both?

20thSentryFox:
<:Huaji:414068953615171584>

Reaper:
i liek 3 MGs

Reaper:
xD

Slave to the Caffeine:
depends on what your using the squad for

Reaper:
hmm

Slave to the Caffeine:
best hg changes based on that

Reaper:
true

Reaper:
what are SG/MG best used for?

Actias Luna:
Mk23's active gives a lot of FP as well, and it's not dependent on attacking a single enemy.

CptHenry:
Guess I'll shoot for something like this for my future SG/MG Echelon

Slave to the Caffeine:
mk23 is the best all purpose one, but not the best at a given role

Actias Luna:
You'd want to pick depending on which you can get the best mileage out of.

Reaper:
hmm i see

Reaper:
contender would be best for bosses i guess?

Slave to the Caffeine:
indeed

Actias Luna:
You tend not to use MGSG for bosses, is the issue.

Slave to the Caffeine:
thats

Actias Luna:
But if you wanted to do so, it would.

Slave to the Caffeine:
.not true at all

Slave to the Caffeine:
unless they have force shield triggers

Slave to the Caffeine:
then it is true

Reaper:
hmm

Actias Luna:
Shotguns aren't very good tanks against bosses.

Slave to the Caffeine:
depends

Actias Luna:
I'll clarify I'm speaking about given current EN content.

Slave to the Caffeine:
ah

c3:
unless they're pizza lion, you mean?

Slave to the Caffeine:
im speaking from CN content

Reaper:
hmm

Reaper:
i see

Actias Luna:
Ya. Shotguns become more viable later on, but we have more tools to make them work as well. >.>

Tom Brady:
if you send a MGSG to Elphelt

Tom Brady:
you're gonna be crying

SleepyDuck:

SleepyDuck:

Some_Person:

commie:
what does pd stand for

Chiaki:
ask him

suguri:
<@!84323276083433472> the skill text says after reloading the buff is applied

commie:
I don't speak weird peninsula language :S

suguri:
but in reality it's just the first 3 shots in a clip

Chiaki:
exactly

Chiaki:
i actually researched that before, that's why i knew it

suguri:

Chiaki:

Tom Brady:

Sparkee100:
Is that WF on main room

Sparkee100:
Ahhhhh

KDaeho:
*bulli groza*

Some_Person:
no bulli

Chiaki:
otherwise, bar wouldn't be that great for data, you could just use pk to get better results since you don't reload and they have similar atk power while pk gets her passive

The Laughing Man:
Wtf PD Negev

suguri:
haha wtf

suguri:
primed chamber is a $300 mod

suguri:

Reeee where's my g11 so i can complete furniture collection

suguri:
100% truth posting

august99us:
:beer16:

commie:
yeah same here

commie:
M2HB, which isn't hard at all, and a lucky MG5 pull

commie:
out of a rage craft surprisingly

CptHenry:
No pkp though <:SOPMODfunnyfeic:427804752701554719>

commie:
I have a strange track record when it comes to rage crafting

CptHenry:
I have MG5 and PK

Some_Person:
I have m2hb and pk, all of my mgs I got were from drops or events

commie:
yesterday I got mad and got a WA2000 4 contracts in on a rage craft

Some_Person:
I have terrible mg recipe rng

suguri:
inb4 m2hb gets a mod

Some_Person:
waiting for that moment

august99us:
I still wouldnt use uer

suguri:
becomes big 1 mg

august99us:
Her

august99us:
Until they make her cuter

suguri:
yeah but what if her mod art was good

august99us:
üò°

commie:
but it's a browning design :V

august99us:
^^;

CptHenry:
I dont like M2HB

suguri:
mod 2 skill: white feather

commie:
you imagine browning's face on her instead of her animu face

CptHenry:
Here look is very unappealing

Some_Person:
She too cute for you

suguri:
4th hits now have 100% accuracy and crit

suguri:
<:OK:500692128058572800>

CptHenry:
She too bimbo for me

suguri:
tribute to hathcock

CptHenry:
And m1919 is too loli for me

commie:
just ignore her looks and use her for gameplay

commie:
:^)

CptHenry:
I'll stick with LWMMG since she's getting a mod

CptHenry:
And she looks good with it

Some_Person:
<:hkStare2:414084643848192006>

commie:
M2HB might be good for farming data though

commie:
high damage and irrelevant low accuracy

Some_Person:
She is handy for that purpose

suguri:
the top mgs for data farming right now are pkp m2hb and bar mod3

suguri:
though after mod lwmmg mod 3 would be interchangeable with bar

suguri:
since they'd fill the same niche

commie:
without mod you'd probably want a PK

commie:
tfw you pulled an MG5

commie:
wouldn't you want to go 4 MGs anyway?

commie:
4 MGs and a MK23 is what I've assumed was a data farm team so far

commie:
contender as an alternative

SleepyDuck:
Quack

august99us:
3mg 2hg kinda same

suguri:
adding a 4th mg gives you less than 33% dps increase

Some_Person:
ü¶Ü

SleepyDuck:
M2HB is ggood

commie:
compared to a handgun buff?

suguri:
since you're using a weaker mg than the 3 already

SleepyDuck:
SHE IS THICC

SleepyDuck:
VERY THICCCC

Some_Person:
very thicc

suguri:
meanwhile hgs can buff 36% damage+

suguri:
the postmod ones anyway

SleepyDuck:
Wait for babushka mod 3

SleepyDuck:
<:RibBleeding:415391866822066176>

ibn5100:
Finally found the  instrumental of this menu

ibn5100:
it's from Deep Dive

commie:
hm I suppose that until then 4 MG and mk23 should be the standard

commie:
3 MG and mk23 plus contender but who the hell has contender :V

Some_Person:
pretty much ^

SleepyDuck:
Deep dive makes most of guilty gear tracks i think

Some_Person:
But, but I has contendie

commie:
if u you flex <:NOPE:500694246429556757>

SleepyDuck:
I no hav tendies

SleepyDuck:
I WANT MY TENDIES

SleepyDuck:
<:hkStare2:414084643848192006>

commie:
I don't even want her

SleepyDuck:
Wtf

commie:
just give me a welrod so I can finally do my RFHG

commie:
please

commie:
contender can come later

SleepyDuck:
Im gonna marry Elphet

SleepyDuck:
Hnnnggg

commie:
contender's for making your echelons even stronger

SleepyDuck:
<:YES:427808453868781568>

august99us:
M1895 is better than mk23 for data

SleepyDuck:
But mk23 is cuter

commie:
I just want the basic echelons set up first

SleepyDuck:
And calls you darling

Chiaki:
but bar has the 3 first shots mechanic <@!219680275402194945>

commie:

Hikimouto:

HazardousJay:
Next batch is where ill really blow all my resources

commie:
the shotgun one?

HazardousJay:
Yeah

commie:
technically our next batch is this one with the 5 dolls

HazardousJay:
I meant the shotty's yeah

commie:
but they really don't seem to be that good, so outside of aesthetic reasons I think one would skip it

HazardousJay:
This rate up  ill just go for rfb and t5000 and thats it

commie:
t-5k doesn't seem to do anything better than SVD

commie:
that accuracy buff? hm

Chiaki:
she's on par with svd, just a bit weaker

HazardousJay:
Its the novelty of keeping one, ill put her alongside SVD on my russkie rifle squad

Chiaki:
acc buff is meaningless, yeah

commie:
yeah exactly, if you have a specific non-effectiveness reason to want one then sure, it's perfectly understandable to want them

c3:
if you can't ge svd dupes, she's good enough. it's not like we have all that many rof rf's to choose from

commie:
shipka has to compete with much better SMGs :V

commie:
like IDW

HazardousJay:
I cored all my SVD dupes <:SOPMODfunnyfeic:427804752701554719>

commie:
who has exactly the same niche but is clearly much better

commie:
she has a beautiful voice and has an easy timer to get, that one she shares with grizzly

commie:
I am somewhat salty, was expecting more than a single grizzly with this retarded HG build spree I did

Chiaki:
man if there's one thing i can say about idw is that at least she's not pp90

c3:
I need shipka so that I can pair her with pp-19 when we get her<:SOPwao:465878170046955521>

Pacbough:

suguri:
<:pp90blush:425688701633298434>

commie:
pp-90 danya

commie:
pp-90 is better than idw because she gives 3 cores 8)

c3:
pp90 is cute in her own way, but that doesn't tickle my fancy

HazardousJay:
PP-19 at the rescue event pls <:SOPwao:465878170046955521>

commie:
we're supposed to vote for the dolls on the rescue event it seems

c3:
from the appearance at least, yes. only question is what choices they will give us

c3:
inb4 kar

commie:
so I am a bit sceptical about getting yet to be released dolls

Chiaki:
inb4 very limiting picks

c3:
^

Some_Person:
idw pick

commie:
I mean they have to balance it somewhat

FlueneCha:
I believe we'll get IWS

FlueneCha:
<:YES:427808453868781568>

commie:
a shame that the chance of getting limited dolls is virtually none üò†

is it actually stupidly difficult or just time-consuming?

Some_Person:
to farm for 57?

commie:
I suppose killing the boss for her

Some_Person:
I think 57 drops from beating the boss. So you are right

commie:
but then again if even koreans complain about this

commie:
but yeah, if it's just time-consuming then it isn't that bad

commie:
but if the boss is ass to kill then eh

More so time consuming.

Siege Waifus:

SleepyDuck:
Spas and saiga probably

Kfish:
<:creepySPAS:484729768370110482>

Siege Waifus:

commie:

SleepyDuck:
Time to watch my parts get fucking destroyed

Kfish:
captain china uwu

Pacbough:
they already announced the 5 dolls for december?

ndfspro8901:
My salt right now is i cant reach the elphelt battle cause im resource struggling

SleepyDuck:
December is T91, T5000, RFB, Amelli

Pacbough:
and no shotguns

commie:
we're getting 5 doll releases, seems odd to get another set released that soon

[EyoN]:
yup

Siege Waifus:
That, and doing a 6264 Tier 3 and getting a SVD

SleepyDuck:
Shotguns is jan

commie:
or are you being an ass and saying "next month" because it's already december?

commie:
:V

SleepyDuck:
I SAID NEXT MONTH YOU DORKS

Siege Waifus:
When next week there's more dolls that could use those 50 contracts

commie:
IT'S BEEN DECEMBER FOR 50 MINUTES HERE

SleepyDuck:
<:SOPMODfunnyfeic:427804752701554719> üó°

commie:

SleepyDuck:
Saiga spas and prrobs a few others

commie:

SleepyDuck:
We gonna get brutally smashed

SleepyDuck:
<:minkFAL:410657215486230528>

SleepyDuck:
Everyone wants lesbo saiga

commie:
in any case, I think it's fairly safe to skip december rate up

Siege Waifus:
it is?

commie:
none of these dolls is anything particularly amazing

Siege Waifus:
oof

SleepyDuck:
Amelli  <@160911952305061888>

SleepyDuck:
Is thicc

commie:
so if you're not specifically looking for one of them

SleepyDuck:
So u shut up

ndfspro8901:
They dont seem like it

Siege Waifus:
cool

SleepyDuck:
<:NOPE:500694246429556757>

Pacbough:
i have my logistics going for production contracts

commie:
ok but for reasons other than t h i c c

Pacbough:
<:SOPMODfunnyfeic:427804752701554719>

SleepyDuck:
She has free summer skin that shows her ass

commie:
I dunno, maybe save your contracts for meme T3 heavy production in january?

SleepyDuck:
<:umpOwO:500681384226979840>

ndfspro8901:
I actually like the new handgun though

SleepyDuck:
Fuck T3

Siege Waifus:
I'll till do a few more contracts than I should, but guess I won't do 100 like I did for Contender

commie:
just kill your cores

SleepyDuck:
Im a T1 pleb

ndfspro8901:
She looks coolio

SleepyDuck:
<:RibBleeding:415391866822066176>

Siege Waifus:
and then get her on the next day's dailies

SleepyDuck:
I did T3 once

General BLT:
T1 is best HP

SleepyDuck:
Got a fucking mosin

SleepyDuck:
I want to kms

Siege Waifus:

General BLT:

Siege Waifus:
same but a SVD

Pacbough:
i got ptrd

Pacbough:
i mean PTSD

SleepyDuck:
Oof

Some_Person:
I got IWS

General BLT:
At least SVD is good without super rare equipment

ndfspro8901:
I had ptrd on my previous account that i lost

SleepyDuck:
Fuck you  <@371060957524262912>

commie:
but yeah, RFB is a good but niche use AR, T5k is a decent but inferior to SVD rifle, T91 is a good night battle rifle but nothing spectacular

SleepyDuck:
<:g11spit:410657877825683456>

Siege Waifus:
PTRD at least is a nice bed furniture üòè

commie:
ameli is one of those long initial cd MGs iirc

SleepyDuck:
Amelli is for NIGHT BATTLES

SleepyDuck:
<:pp90blush:425688701633298434>

General BLT:
As bad as M60?

SleepyDuck:
Like she actually is

SleepyDuck:
I just want her for her summer skin

SleepyDuck:
So i got a thicc sexy waifu

SleepyDuck:
<:hkLewded:484732421485494272>

Sparkee100:

Rose ‚ôß:
I'll bring my neighbor's dog as a sacrifice

commie:

commie:
I have upgraded my name

Some_Person:
nice name

commie:
I'll be laughing at you when I drop my PK

commie:
I mean

commie:
when I don't drop my PK

Some_Person:
Already got my pk from 0-2

Rose ‚ôß:
*desire sensor is confused*

c3:
I got pk drop in under 250 runs <:RibDiedInside:414195386199179265>

Rose ‚ôß:
same

Rose ‚ôß:
Twice

Some_Person:
got mine on my 9th run

commie:
~~this is actually all a ploy in order to get me welrod~~

commie:


commie:
üëÄ

ndfspro8901:
I have 2 dorms but havent done nothin with the 2nd

Siege Waifus:
spend tokens

commie:


commie:
the game's actually just being nice and letting me link HGs without spending cores

commie:
instead of not giving me welrod üò†

Siege Waifus:
could be worse

Lilya Starikova:
What the hell is going on blin

commie:
decided to be a bit more liberal with my contracts because truth be told, not looking forward to any of the rate up dolls

commie:
trying to get the last piece I need for WASVD

Siege Waifus:
you could have M1918 dupes when you are rolling for literally any 5* MG

Siege Waifus:
M1919*

ndfspro8901:
I have an outfit for M1919A1 but i dont have her. It bugs me

Siege Waifus:
lol

Siege Waifus:
how?

commie:
she's fairly common, you'll drop her when you farm the common exp maps

ndfspro8901:
Ah

Siege Waifus:
she dropped so much for me in the event maps lol

Siege Waifus:
it was her, PPS-43 and Makarov

ndfspro8901:
I just cant seem to get her

ndfspro8901:
Nice name btw lmao

Siege Waifus:
who?

ndfspro8901:
You

Siege Waifus:
lol

commie:
no, me of course :^)

Siege Waifus:
danke

commie:
I have the most creative names

ndfspro8901:
You dont want to drop a PK on 0-2

commie:
it's actually a trick question

commie:
I do in fact not want to drop a PK on 0-2 *wink wink nudge nudge*

ndfspro8901:
I dont understand 90% of the meanings of stuff in this game

Siege Waifus:
you're not supposed to

ndfspro8901:
I havent contracted 100% weeb status yet

commie:
I think the context is simple enough

commie:
0-2 is clearly a particular stage, and from the word "drop" you can deduce that PK is some kind of rare drop on this specific map

commie:
well, rare is relative

ndfspro8901:
Ah but are you imllying that shes common?

ndfspro8901:
Implying*

ndfspro8901:
Damn keyboard

commie:
nah, she's pretty rare

commie:
getting 4*s to drop on regular stages are rare enough

commie:
5*s then 8)

ndfspro8901:
I never get good drops from missions im gauranteed 2*

commie:
further ahead you'll have less trouble dropping 3*s

commie:
0-2 is known for being a place to farm both EXP and cores

commie:
also PKs, but those are less real than money in my wallet

ndfspro8901:
Even if a mission says it only has 3* + drops i still get 2* i dont get it

Kfish:
uwu

SleepyDuck:
Is this a new shikikunt

SleepyDuck:
<:creepySPAS:484729768370110482>

[EyoN]:
2000 runs and I haven't seen a PK

[EyoN]:
;-;

SleepyDuck:
Welcome to the salt mine

SleepyDuck:
<:g11spit:410657877825683456>

commie:
seen worse salt mines tbh

commie:
this is almost nothing compared to the salt I've witnessed

SleepyDuck:
<@307521892963713024> it only shows the highest rarity drops

1danny1032:
<@307521892963713024> just because you see only 3*+ in the list, does not mean it shows the entire list sadly

SleepyDuck:
You can get worse guns

ndfspro8901:
Salt

SleepyDuck:

you can't get a f2k from 0-2

PotatoTheFirst:


FlueneCha:
I would do an HK21 one if I had a PC rip

PotatoTheFirst:
if you look at the DPS8s you can clearly see putting wa at the top gives you less dps

Siege Waifus:
what is that site?

PotatoTheFirst:
https://gfeasdf.github.io/gf/main2.html

Siege Waifus:
owo

Siege Waifus:
jesus christ this keyboard

Chiaki:
dps20s is irrelevant, nothing will last 20s lol

Bladedknight:
I finally got AEK

Bladedknight:
after 1 MG5 2PKP 4 Negev

PotatoTheFirst:
if you reach 20s your team is dead

c3:
wrong channel for that

Bladedknight:
fuck me

PotatoTheFirst:
pkk and calico aint tanking that

Bladedknight:
I wasted so much resources

nguuuquaaa:
I thought later on everything will last 20s

Chiaki:
hardly

Chiaki:
we'll have more damage with fairies

FlueneCha:
Yeah

Y.Zhang:
Welrod may fetch you better results

PotatoTheFirst:
i assume he doesn't own welrod

Chiaki:
only bosses last that much

c3:
I'll add it to my list then, I'll ping you when it's done

FlueneCha:
Thanks

Pacbough:
<:SOPwao:465878170046955521>

c3:
btw, her art and her actual sprite have that peek-a-boo on different sides, which do you prefer?

FlueneCha:
Left (her right) is fine

FlueneCha:
I mean the cover

FlueneCha:
Like my costume pfp

c3:
k, I'll probably go for the default costume first though, since that's recognizable. I could give the costume another try later

commie:
more ribs?

commie:
*o h n o*

FlueneCha:
Nah I wanted the original too

Pacbough:
oh Y E S

Chiaki:
oh <:YES:427808453868781568>

FlueneCha:
Only said it for reference

commie:
too many ~~cooks~~ ribs

SleepyDuck:
I got AEK in 1 try

Pacbough:
never enough ribs

SleepyDuck:
From stasi's vodoo

SleepyDuck:
<:creepySPAS:484729768370110482>

FlueneCha:
I got AEK trying to pull mk48

FlueneCha:
Might as well use her instead eh

uncaged (nick):
Pulled two Vectors back-to-back. üò±

commie:
rip all of your luck

ndfspro8901:
Tried conpleting thelast mission on chapter 3 and jesus the boss shredded my best team

commie:
use slave friend echelons to do it

ndfspro8901:
Idk how support echelons work. Cause i just used one and it wouldnt even let me do anything with it in planning mode

commie:
yeah they're autonomous

commie:
just set it to "capture hq" and take care to not let your own HQ be captured or encircled

„ÅÑ„Å∞„Çâ:
yup

commie:
it will take you a while since they only move one node per turn

commie:
but a sufficiently strong friend echelon will destroy everything since infinite supplies

ndfspro8901:
Idk if i can use another support today though that was my 1st time using one and it was useless lmao

commie:
you get 20 per day

Rose ‚ôß:
deploy support echelon ---> tap on it, twice --> give it the proper command

commie:
each friend echelon has a cooldown though

ndfspro8901:
Oh thanks m8

commie:
but if you buy 20 friends, you can use 20 a day

ndfspro8901:
Oof

Rose ‚ôß:
> buy 20 friends

Kfish:
i love springfield daily reminder 68

ndfspro8901:
I have more than enough friends

Kfish:
tomorrow is a very special day<:karlicious:414085222217416705>

c3:
just buy more dorms, insta friend generator

commie:
dorms cost money tho

ndfspro8901:
Bunch of ol randos added me from reddit

Rose ‚ôß:
They're not real friends

Rose ‚ôß:
They just want your batteries

ndfspro8901:
Yonk

c3:
isn't the the truth for all?

commie:
I'll be your friend, I just need the 16 numbers on your credit card, the 3 numbers on the back and the month and year of expiration

Kfish:
i only friend people with springfield icon

commie:
but you have to do it fast

Rose ‚ôß:
Nah

commie:
or else I will become someone else's friend

Rose ‚ôß:
I don't care about how many dorms people have

ndfspro8901:
Good one

Siege Waifus:
Chapter 3 boss is stupidly damaging

Rose ‚ôß:
you could have 2 dorms and I wouldn't mind it

Siege Waifus:
Chapter 4 and 5 bosses are easier than 3 tbh

commie:
hi I have 2 dorms

IWI Negev NG5:
Is it bad that I got SAT then disassembled her right away just to piss someone off

Vinen:

Vinen:

Vinen:
without crafting

IWI Negev NG5:
***is currently in core hell***

c3:
you just wasted 10 cores, but that's nothing anyway

PotatoTheFirst:

10 cores to piss some1 off is a good deal

like Green <:homete:410658578014273538>

PotatoTheFirst:
yeah i started with all my 4 and 5 stars and it hurts

IWI Negev NG5:
Except it was 3 4 stars to level 90

PotatoTheFirst:
i leveled a budget ar team just to save up some cores

Vinen:
I need to catalog my units

Vinen:
and build teams around what I have

IWI Negev NG5:
I'm building a 3hg 2rf team rn

PotatoTheFirst:
i wish i had calico

Vinen:
I have 3 Calico at 100

PotatoTheFirst:
but after 4 months of daily's she's still not come home

Vinen:
<:RibBleeding:415391866822066176>

IWI Negev NG5:
Calico is great except evasion

IWI Negev NG5:
Kind of bad

IWI Negev NG5:
Not too bad

Siege Waifus:
Calico is green haired cutie

IWI Negev NG5:
I am using 
WA PPK
 Griz Cali
 SVD

IWI Negev NG5:
And now we level them up

PotatoTheFirst:
switch svd and wa

IWI Negev NG5:
Can I ask why

PotatoTheFirst:
when skills are active wa will cap at 120

PotatoTheFirst:
so you over buff her rof with ppk

IWI Negev NG5:
Ah right sounds fine to me

PotatoTheFirst:
so its better to put svd there so its equals out more

IWI Negev NG5:
Makes sense. They're only at 50-60 right now tho

PotatoTheFirst:
seems like you'll max out both

PotatoTheFirst:
but wa will be higher then svd on the bottom

PotatoTheFirst:
so more total dps

IWI Negev NG5:
Why do people dislike MG based teams so much?

PotatoTheFirst:
idk

PotatoTheFirst:
i love mg's

IWI Negev NG5:
Bad against bosses, but not much else

PotatoTheFirst:
they do suck in night battles

PotatoTheFirst:
atleast against normal enemies

c3:
they pointlessly eat a lot of ressources that other compositions could do just as well, if not better

IWI Negev NG5:
Ah

c3:
mg, like rf squads, are best used for specific usage cases

IWI Negev NG5:
I have at least 40k in everything and ammo is 80k

PotatoTheFirst:
i use my svd/wa squad for everything

c3:
ar based teams should be your general go-to team

c3:
gl in 4n onwards with that

IWI Negev NG5:
I use my ARSMG teams for everything my MGs can't

Ayeccs:
hold up potato

Ayeccs:
if you equalize their rof it would be possible they shoot the same target, causing a wasted shot if it does enough damage

IWI Negev NG5:
So what do I do then

PotatoTheFirst:
nah was talking about if they're in the same position

PotatoTheFirst:
they both cap at the top

PotatoTheFirst:
but wa has a better rof on the bottom

Ayeccs:
not svd cause her max skill is 10% lower than wa

PotatoTheFirst:
in his formation it will

PotatoTheFirst:
ppk buffs rof more then welrod

IWI Negev NG5:
I'm piss poor at this game even at level 80

Ayeccs:
svd only has calico buff

PotatoTheFirst:
on problem you got with that team is you got no frontline

IWI Negev NG5:
Calico buffs both

PotatoTheFirst:
I am using 
WA PPK
 Griz Cali
 SVD

nguuuquaaa:
why put WA on bottom when you can put her on top and have higher total DPS

PotatoTheFirst:
thats his team

Ayeccs:
I know

PotatoTheFirst:
ppk buffs rof and with skills will max the rof of svd

IWI Negev NG5:
Literal copy paste lmao

FlueneCha:
I run WA on 7 but I use Welrod

Ayeccs:
ppk isn't reaching svd

IWI Negev NG5:
Nope

c3:
not using holy cross smh

PotatoTheFirst:
i told him to switch them

PotatoTheFirst:
they both cap at the top

PotatoTheFirst:
but wa has a higher rof on her own so its better to put her on the bottom

Ayeccs:
if they both shoot at max cap and 1 shot from them kills 1, the other shot is wasted

Ayeccs:
so you want some rof difference so you prevent that

nguuuquaaa:
you say it like overbuff is a bad thing

PotatoTheFirst:
is it that hard to understand that wa doesn't cap when she's at the bottom?

Ayeccs:
but then svd does since she gets both buffs

nguuuquaaa:
if either choice results in overbuff then choose stuff with higher damage

nguuuquaaa:
SVD cap when she's at top too

PotatoTheFirst:
yes but less rof is wasted then when you over buff svd

IWI Negev NG5:
Hell with it I'll leave it the same

nguuuquaaa:
"waste"

nguuuquaaa:
do you know that putting WA at bottom is also a waste of potential DPS?

FlueneCha:
I run this because SVD is stinki

FlueneCha:
WA2k gang

nguuuquaaa:
if you want to calculate, calculate *all* the stuff

Ayeccs:
that's the go-to

commie:

Some_Person:

Sheodoq:
Welrod is a good girl

Some_Person:

Sheodoq:
Don't forget to bully Elphelt

Sheodoq:

Rose ‚ôß:
not surprising if it is mg4

commie:
I can't justify using shrimp üòê

Sheodoq:
But 130 AP is a big advantage

commie:
I got her to level 90 a couple of weeks ago but I can't get myself to link her 5x

Sheodoq:
Why not?

Rose ‚ôß:
so is having a 260% 4 cd damg buff

commie:
I don't see a need for that much DPS right now

Sheodoq:
With smg dmg vs MG damage

commie:
at least I haven't got to a point that I need her niche

Rose ‚ôß:
mg4 is one of the worst mgs out there tho

Sheodoq:
But Shrimp is a good girl

Some_Person:
no bulli mg4

commie:
I also pulled vector :^)

Sheodoq:
If you lose with a 130 damage advantage then idk what to say

Rose ‚ôß:
you could even argue negev is better than mg4

commie:
so I can't pull welrod but the game slaps me with all the other rarer HGs

commie:
ok thanks mica

Chiaki:
judging by the most common used recipe

Arcus:
rng is different for everyone

Chiaki:
130*4

Chiaki:
both have 0.8%

commie:
is there any reason to use 130 parts?

Chiaki:
no

Arcus:
i mean I have 3 calicos but it took forever to get welrod

Chiaki:
but somehow 130 130 130 30 isn't that used, it has like 13k attempts registered, while 130*4 has over 2.5kk

commie:
might be placebo or just people pressing the +100 on each resource instead of just 3

Rose ‚ôß:
simply rngesus

commie:
I am good ‚úù boi, pls gib welrod

commie:
tbh I shouldn't be complaining

commie:
I had the most amazing luck last night

Rose ‚ôß:
I would give you a welrod if I could

commie:
eh until then I can always use makarov and ppk I suppose

commie:
or makarov and calico, but I'd have to move calico every battle eeeeehhhhhhhhh

CptHenry:
I'm doing that too

c3:
event stages drop makarovs like mad

Shmack (Salt Dog):
What's the IWS exodia setup again?

Chiaki:
when i finished today's farm

stech, calico, welrod and 5-7

can you get 9A on E4?

I have two right now but I can only remember pulling 1 on daily crafts

c3:
so it would appear

nguuuquaaa:
you can get 9A in E4
I got 1 from my first run (A rank)

suguri:
people use 130 all because that's the hg recipe kalina forces you to do during tutorial

google isn't helping me much

Siege Waifus:
dolls tell stories of their past

more lore basically

commie:
does it do anything for gameplay?

Siege Waifus:
also don't know much about it, just what I think it is

Chiaki:
not really

Siege Waifus:
nothing

Siege Waifus:
like dorms

Chiaki:
it's just more lore on girls

commie:
alright thank

Siege Waifus:
no, like data room

commie:
data room has a gameplay element though

commie:
it lets you generate more exp from exp farming

c3:
eh, all it does is increase the efficiency of creating reports, which actually makes playing the game less necessary as you can just floppy your girls to 100

c3:
ü§∑

commie:
better exp gains from time invested into the game

python gsh

Below Vol

commie:
and not as late as five-seven

Chiaki:
no way

Sparkee100:
She is top3

Chiaki:
t91 is better than vol

commie:
I mean vol is pretty low :V

Chiaki:
it's like

Sparkee100:
Vol is trash

Sparkee100:
:3

Sparkee100:
No offense to vol "lover"

Chiaki:
groza > 9A with equip > t91 = 9A without equip > t65 > val

FlueneCha:
Grozalets are a thing?

Chiaki:
yes

FlueneCha:
<:SOPMODfunnyfeic:427804752701554719>

commie:
level 31

commie:
oof

Vinen:
ü§¢

Vinen:
non max Groza

Chiaki:
skl4 thonk

FlueneCha:
I don't have a use for her

FlueneCha:
Lol

commie:
8)

Chiaki:
now that's an even bigger thonk

commie:
>yeah it's kind of sad, but us who started later have to deal with not having the best night AR

commie:
>lul level 31 groza don't even need her

Sparkee100:
I need to max her skill.  She is at 9 :3

Sparkee100:
Finally max skill bamboo m99 and ntw today

commie:
fug, accidentally ended a round on E4

Sparkee100:
F

FlueneCha:
I didn't feel the need to make a night ar squad

Mei:
whim whim , whats the best HG at night

Chiaki:
depends on your setup

FlueneCha:
I ran WAVD on OP Cube

Chiaki:
<:thonk9:410657576892497930>

Mei:
lets say groza and 9a

Mei:
and 2 smg tank

commie:
grizzly?

Chiaki:
grizzly

commie:
that's kind of a no brainer

Chiaki:
but also maybe type59

Mei:
october loligun ?

Sparkee100:
Megane Loli is gud

Chiaki:
and sometimes you would want to run stecchi

Chiaki:
it's based on the enemies

FlueneCha:
I already have 3 AR squads <:SOPMODfunnyfeic:427804752701554719>

Arcus:
Rof boost to cap

Mei:
<:OK:500692128058572800>

FlueneCha:
I don't  want more

Chiaki:
more armored = grizzly
more dodgies = t59
mix of both = stech

Vinen:
stinky

Vinen:
kun

Sparkee100:
Groza squad will help greatly during night battles

Vinen:
who is the stech

commie:
backline RoF buffer?

commie:
is that HG with a stock

commie:
and uh, the pikachu hair thing

Arcus:
RoF buffer with a bit of FP on the side

commie:
she's a rare-ish 4* HG

Pungey:
Froggy

Pungey:
Terries getting froggy

commie:
what would be rarer, a stechkin or a welrod?

Arcus:
welrod

Sparkee100:
Stech

commie:
the thing about asking questions like that is

Sparkee100:
Piglets

commie:
yeah, but is it on a 2 second cd?

Vinen:
Piglets is Ameli

Rievakins:
6 seconds. :V

Sparkee100:
Wah

Chiaki:
2 second initial? sure

Rievakins:
ameli is just for fetish

Sparkee100:
Ameli ain't a piglet

Chiaki:
she would be nice

Sparkee100:
Ameli is for protect

Rievakins:
I mean, is there a reason to use rfb?

Chiaki:
yes

Sparkee100:
Night

Chiaki:
no

Chiaki:
durable guards with jaegers

Chiaki:
in arsmg team

commie:
I imagine she can reasonably delete backlines fast enough after 6 seconds, you just won't be able to not take damage

Chiaki:
guards deal no dmg but jaegers fucking destroy your smgs

Chiaki:
that would be the only reason to use her

Sparkee100:
Hmm

suguri:
guards are big damage sponges

Chiaki:
in which case you can also just use wa, svd or something similar too, with same results

Krimzi:
currently running an echelon with 416, soppo, m4a1, ump9 and 45 who should i look to swap out

Rievakins:
suppose rf target backlines but they don't?

Rievakins:
ump9

commie:
eh they will soon enough

Rievakins:
also 416 and soppo together is bad.

suguri:
sop because I can see you're a man of culture

Sparkee100:
<@184862051967959041> what ru swapping

suguri:
<:OK:500692128058572800>

commie:
the RFs might get stuck on the first guard but they'll delete it fast enough to start working on the backline, even before their skills activate

Rievakins:
unless manual.

Krimzi:
looking to swap out one of the smgs and one of the ARs for a bettter fit

Rievakins:
if you get vector or shrimp, keep 416

commie:
AR-15 instead of 416?

commie:
other than that it's a solid beginner ARSMG

Rievakins:
tfw that no one seems to use homete

Krimzi:
I think i'll swap UMP9 for Vector since i have both vector and shrimp

Chiaki:
getting a leveled 416 is nice, it's the start of a long term relationship with 0-2

commie:
people usually prefer 1 offensive offtank smg and 1 defensive one, but there's nothing wrong with 2 defensive SMGs

Luxanna:
Also

Luxanna:
*inhales*

commie:
FAL and soppo should be enough

Rievakins:
wot, why would you not swap out ump9 sooner

Luxanna:
DAILY REMINDER THAT **I LOVE VAL**

Rievakins:
she has shit buffs.

Krimzi:
I have a Homete but i need to level her up

Sparkee100:
I use g41 in my arsmg squad cuz my G11 is always occupied for 02

Chiaki:
ump9's buffs are great

Chiaki:
what are you talking about

Sparkee100:
Ump45/9 combo is nice

Rievakins:
compared to ump45's buff

commie:
G41 seems to be good on a rib ARSMG echelon

Sparkee100:
Rib doesn't buff herself right?

Rievakins:
ye

Sparkee100:
Sad life of a rib

Krimzi:
i'll ttyl got to start heading to class

Krimzi:
but before i go who should i swap out for soppo

Rievakins:
no one

commie:
just spend your time on discord while on the lecture

Rievakins:
soppo best

Rievakins:
plus 2 acc slots.

FlueneCha:


ndfspro8901:


ndfspro8901:
3rd damn dupe

CptHenry:
Is G36 good?

Sparkee100:
416 is all u need

commie:
yeah that's what you would use for a rib

commie:
2 self damage buffing ARs

Rievakins:
g36 is good for buffing shrimp

commie:
since Rib's skill buffs dmg and rof iirc

CptHenry:
Oh

FlueneCha:
G36 has offensive tiles

CptHenry:
Guess I need G36 then

commie:
hah

commie:
good luck m8

FlueneCha:
I'm running Vector there

suguri:
rib also buffs acc but it's not something you notice often

ndfspro8901:
Ive got g36

commie:
but you're a lucc sacc

FlueneCha:
G36 was easy for me

ndfspro8901:
Just not sure what kind of setup to use

Chiaki:
oof

commie:
<@135643154530435072> you don't "need" to get any doll right now

commie:
focus on what you've got, or you'll just be disappointed and start rage crafting

Chiaki:
pretty much

commie:
be happy

FlueneCha:
Got her before g41 and got another one trying to get Ribey

commie:
game is for enjoy

Chiaki:
there are no limited dolls

Chiaki:
except the event ones

Sparkee100:
Ye just work with whatever u got

Chiaki:
that's why you should focus on what you have

FlueneCha:
I never asked to get g36

Chiaki:
so you can get those

commie:
besides, the game senses your desire

CptHenry:
Well, alright then

Rievakins:
tfw no g11

commie:
you must earn the game's favor or the game's pity in order to pull what you wanted

Chiaki:
no jean reno daddy

it's probably not that impressive depending on how many contracts he spent

does mica change the gun design significantly with mod?

commie:
I imagine that there would have been the possibility of introducing an EBR later down the road

commie:
though at this point, it's unlikely because of how popular M14 is

Chiaki:
they stated that ebr would be a different t-doll

CptHenry:

At least I found another GFL lad

Kitsune:

Kitsune:
<:g36Lazy:481469060589027329>

commie:
tacticooler, nice

Vinen:
<@169929415159971841> the key protagonist pfps are multiplying ü§¢

Kitsune:

Kitsune:

Vinen:
<:OK:500692128058572800>

Vinen:

Kitsune:
usually more

commie:
it's reverse degeneracy

Vinen:
<:M4A1depression:410654965892382721>

commie:
the players like girls more when they put more clothing on :V

Kitsune:
you could argue that g36 is wearing less

Kitsune:
since she's exposing her midriff

Chiaki:
maid tummy <:SOPwao:465878170046955521>

Cammerhammer:
Meido loses her long locks, though

Cammerhammer:
It's sad

Kitsune:
there's an instory reason tho

Kitsune:
so good enough for me

Vinen:
there is plot ü§î

Chiaki:
character development <:OK:500692128058572800>

Cammerhammer:
Fair

commie:
plot explaining clothing changes?

Kitsune:
all mod dolls have stories

Kitsune:
yeah

Cammerhammer:
Couldn't she get glasses, too?

Kitsune:
usually

commie:
this is not your average plot

Cammerhammer:
I want my maid with glasses

commie:
it's a higher plane

Kitsune:
BAR's mod story was a meme

Cammerhammer:
Did she accept her auntieness?

Kitsune:
she got her ass blasted by SASS

Cammerhammer:
Oh

Kyle:
lol

Vinen:
lol

commie:
how does one get destroyed by a gameplaywise inferior doll <:thonk9:410657576892497930>

Chiaki:
then she comes back and now she's grimdark bar

Kitsune:
sass basically criticised her everything

Kitsune:
her work ethic

Kyle:
verbally

Kitsune:
her attitude

Kitsune:
etc etc

Vinen:
SASS MOD KEK

Chiaki:
"you're one of the oldest units and still useless what the hell are you doing"

sass in story is the

'exprerienced newbie'

Cammerhammer:
Experienced ~~in bed~~

Kitsune:

is that a flex that should have been done months ago?

Akuma:

Vinen:
<:RibBleeding:415391866822066176>

ivey-kun:
Is it worth leveling from 90 to 100

ivey-kun:
?

Chiaki:
it's like 5% overall increase in performance

ivey-kun:
Or should I get most of my dolls to 90

Kitsune:
<:g36Lazy:481469060589027329>

ivey-kun:
I see

Akuma:
not much additional

ivey-kun:
Not worth at all

Vinen:
Id get units to 90 first

ivey-kun:
It takes so long after 90

Akuma:
that's why it looks like THIS for me right now

Akuma:


Akuma:

CptHenry:
Think I'll just stick with 5-2e

commie:
tried 0-2?

Kyle:
we dont talk about girlfriends here

CptHenry:
Yeah

commie:
it's okay for full resupply if you're levelling grenadier ARs

CptHenry:
A Shrimp Echelon isn't really meant for that

commie:
yeah that especially

CptHenry:
Plus I'm just leveling Rib

commie:
SMG tanks will take a lot of damage on 0-2

dropkick_tm:
Girlfriend? You mean kalina?

CptHenry:
Kalina is...very meh to me

Lilya Starikova:
kalina is eugh

commie:
not even her live2d is capable of seducing you?

Kyle:
screw you guys, kalina is best girl

Kyle:

~sopposilver~:
<:fncFat:502098769379196928> no one bothers calling kalin by the nick name

~sopposilver~:
shame

CptHenry:
Like, I'd fugg her but my attraction to her does not come close to my attraction for M14 and Welrod

dropkick_tm:
Kalina only real girl in gfl

Kyle:
kalina was ok but then i got her alt outfit

dropkick_tm:
Angelia is taken... sort of

Kyle:
probably ump9

commie:

Kyle:

CptHenry:
M14

commie:
hire a psychiatrist and make him believe that if you die, you will meet ump9 in the afterlife :V

CptHenry:
My love for her was reinforced after seeing her Mod 3

commie:
disclaimer: I don't make good plans

Kyle:
oh damn though, star 15s mod 3 is ‚ù§

commie:
my love of her was reinforced after seeing her GAMEPLAY buffs with mod 3 8)

CptHenry:
Little disappointed Mod 3 M14 wasn't EBR though

CptHenry:
Fak

Peppermint Tea:
Why would you use spitfire when there's NZ75?

ndfspro8901:
What about pkp?

CptHenry:
I'll keep her around

CptHenry:
PKP is good

commie:
spitfire is for an inefficient SGMG layout

Peppermint Tea:
PKP is badass

CptHenry:
In fact she's like the best MG in the game atm

Luxanna:
Pecheng is bae

Lilya Starikova:
Big 4 bby

ndfspro8901:
I cant get her

commie:
PKP is very good but you shouldn't be thinking about MGs right now

CptHenry:
>inb4 LWMMG MOD3 comes in

ndfspro8901:
Mgs cost too much ammo

Lilya Starikova:
Why Not **focus** on what you have now

Lilya Starikova:
Level up

Lilya Starikova:
unlock all maps

Lilya Starikova:
get yer logistics up and running

Lilya Starikova:
tbh

Luxanna:
<@333624167280934912> LUH WUH WUH WUH WUH WUH WUH WUH WUH WUH GUH *reloads* WUH WUH WUH WUH WUH WUH WUH

CptHenry:
Just go through the game with AR/SMG Echelons, focus on other stuff later

commie:
he is having resource problems and wants to pull more dolls? <:suomiNANI:414084644322017280>

Lilya Starikova:
^

Lilya Starikova:
<:RibDiedInside:414195386199179265>

Lilya Starikova:
better get that elphet and noel

Luxanna:
Mgs wont cost any ammo if you just hobo run them till 100

Lilya Starikova:
before it goes HOXY

ndfspro8901:
I mostly just wanna get elphelt outta the way

CptHenry:
Isn't Noel pretty meh?

Luxanna:
Hoxy is the best husbando tbh

Lilya Starikova:
well i got noel

Lilya Starikova:
i have a best idea to tinker noel with

commie:
yeah but then people can point and laugh at you for not having X

commie:
do you wanna be bulli'd?

commie:
tfw no 5-7

CptHenry:
I don't really care about Noel

commie:
or axe gril

CptHenry:
Elphelt looks pretty dang good though

ndfspro8901:
She does

ndfspro8901:
Main reason for wants

Lilya Starikova:
<:RibDiedInside:414195386199179265>

ndfspro8901:
The day i get g11

commie:
don't think about that

Lilya Starikova:
Again

ndfspro8901:
Hard not to lmao

commie:
I pulled mine almost 2 months into the game, focus on your own dolls ._.

Lilya Starikova:
"Focus on leveling up and Unlock all maps for logistics"

commie:
I did fine without her, you will too

Lilya Starikova:
yeah

commie:
if anything she's an ass to raise

Lilya Starikova:
i don't have G11 as well don't worry

commie:
because you need a hella high skill level to make the skill actually work properly

Lilya Starikova:
PTRD came home 1st soo~

ndfspro8901:
I think my biggish problem is fi ding the best synergy

ndfspro8901:
Biggest?

Lilya Starikova:
just look at the tile buffs

Lilya Starikova:
period

commie:
superlative or -ish construction :^)

ndfspro8901:
Im still getting used to a new phone

CptHenry:
Where do I go to get a level 30 to 70 quickly?

ndfspro8901:
Cant type for crap

commie:
typically 4-3E for less effort afk farming

CptHenry:
Rn I'm doing 5-2e

Lilya Starikova:
look

ndfspro8901:
Afk farm?

Lilya Starikova:
if yer echelon can do 0-2

commie:
slap an echelon there, resupply and use planning mode for the 4 enemies

Lilya Starikova:
then why not

commie:
and while your t-dolls clear the map by themselves you pull up ms word and start writing projects that you were meant to do through the entire semester

commie:
but decided to leave for the last weekend 8)

CptHenry:
Do I need 2 echelons for 0-2?

commie:
nope

Kyle:
how's type 79?

Kyle:
decent?

CptHenry:
Decent

commie:
unless you can't clear very well and need 2 echelons to reach the command centre

dropkick_tm:
<@160911952305061888> sounds like stem degree to me

commie:
>stem

commie:
>tfw in humanities

CptHenry:
The echelon I'm using has 15703 ce

Lilya Starikova:
Im running at 32K Ce

dropkick_tm:
Eff humanities and social "science"

Lilya Starikova:
min 25K Ce

commie:
thanks

dropkick_tm:
Sorry bro

Lilya Starikova:
i can push through like 40K CE any time

Vinen:
CE

Vinen:
is a poor measurement of power

commie:
but still, 0-2 has a pretty high mob density and you might have trouble sustaining tanks

commie:
and repairing 2 SMG tanks every time you run 0-2...

Lilya Starikova:
Not when you have Equips tho

commie:
if

dropkick_tm:
<@160911952305061888> but i thought people use m16 for that

commie:
corpse dragging

commie:
if you don't have strong enough dolls for corpse dragging, running 0-2 with full resupply ARSMG echelons is a choice

commie:
I did it a few times but the SMGs take a lot of damage on 0-2

dropkick_tm:
Oof ew

dropkick_tm:
Seriosly go for m16 plus 2 grenadiers

commie:
I went from full resupply 0-2 runs to max equip m16 corpse dragging runs in about a month

commie:
the difference is VERY noticeable

Kyle:
m14 is great

aDgusT:
Burn them all

Lilya Starikova:
Keep those Oats 12

Kyle:
ak47, garand, etc, are bad

Peppermint Tea:
M14 is 3* RF godess

Peppermint Tea:
Also qt af

Kyle:
the game gives you 7 of her from story only though

commie:
I like how his locked ots 12 is the one he isn't using

Luxanna:
<@307521892963713024> level fnc and skorpion

commie:
but the one he is isn't locked

CptHenry:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10LJdksnM3zipOb72IneJD7WVp3765JYJEGg0LnodzDI/edit#gid=1008128016

CptHenry:
This seems accurate

Lilya Starikova:
i dont use Doll analytics

Luxanna:
Just level ur waifus

commie:
just core vol's waifu

Luxanna:
And remember that 416 is all you **don't ** need

Lilya Starikova:
^

Kyle:
hey 416 is a good waifu

CptHenry:
I have a x4 416

Kyle:
he's almost got all of 404

ndfspro8901:
Whatswrong with 416?

commie:
416 is everyone's waifu

commie:
she a thot

Kyle:
i need ump45 still

Kyle:
üò≠

ndfspro8901:
Oof

Luxanna:
<@160911952305061888> have fun coring maidu, wawa, 9a, m14, welrod and g43

CptHenry:
Other dolls do 416's job better

commie:
you waifu a lot of stuff

CptHenry:
Also she's easier to get for a 5 star

commie:
polygamy is very un‚úù

CptHenry:
I waifu'd M14 and Welrod

Luxanna:
<@160911952305061888> I am an atheist

Luxanna:
Though

commie:
‚úù begone ‚úù

Ajss123:
i just use 416 because i got the skin

CptHenry:
Because the game gave me 8 Welrods

ndfspro8901:
I like thompson but i havent been able to see her stengths yet

Luxanna:
But my bestest raifus are maidu and especially vol <:BlobReach:414069175934386177>

CptHenry:
Thompson ain't great

Luxanna:
And g43

commie:
thompson has specific uses, not much for your current situation

Luxanna:
Thompson is trash

Luxanna:
Just use maidus sister aka g36c

ndfspro8901:
Sad

CptHenry:
Plus it's pre-ww2 thompson

Lilya Starikova:
nah Thompson is niche

ndfspro8901:
Cause i likey

Luxanna:
G36c>tommy

Lilya Starikova:
i use em for special occasions

commie:
g36c also rarer than thompson

CptHenry:
Keep Thompson around if you like her

Peppermint Tea:
Thompson can be used all the time

Peppermint Tea:
Just kite

CptHenry:
Just don't expect as good performance as 45 or RO

Lilya Starikova:
PROTECC

commie:
the problem with thompson is that she's a 5* for a merely usable doll

commie:
considering fundamental laws of economics, she's a terrible choice

Luxanna:
<@333624167280934912> I bet she doesnt like that 3* bed

Peppermint Tea:
Thicc hp tho

Luxanna:
<:SOPMODfunnyfeic:427804752701554719>

Scroubignon:
lmao

ndfspro8901:
Huh that sucks but ill keep her

commie:
the opportunity cost of raising a thompson is extremely high

Scroubignon:
She ugly man
Only reason

commie:
because there are many better options :V

Kyle:
you have the ump sisters though

Luxanna:
To be fair

commie:
and cheaper too

Kyle:
which is good for starting

ndfspro8901:
Ump susters are awesome

CptHenry:
Hmm

Luxanna:
Tommy is the cheapest 5* t-doll to raise

ndfspro8901:
Sisters*

Luxanna:
Cuz you get so many dupes of hers

Kyle:
ive never gotten one

CptHenry:
Hmmmm

Kyle:
<:suomiNANI:414084644322017280>

Lilya Starikova:


ndfspro8901:
Can i like

Luxanna:
<@307521892963713024> 45 is godlike, 9 is just good

commie:
yeah but you'll just be leaving her in the background at level 30 and 70 waiting to pull dupes

ndfspro8901:
Have your wa2000?

Kyle:
gotta do those rifle recipes

commie:
at least that's what I'm doing with thompson, springfield, mosin, etc.

CptHenry:
Mine?

Luxanna:
<@307521892963713024> one of 5 wawas I got?

Peppermint Tea:
I just have one Wawa

CptHenry:
Also, is Spitfire any good?

ndfspro8901:
Yea

Peppermint Tea:
5x

commie:
nope

Luxanna:
All 5* I get are dupes

Peppermint Tea:
Er

Kyle:
spitfires not very good

commie:
spitfire is bad for our current content

Kyle:
but she looks great

Luxanna:
Spitfire is uber niche I guess

Lilya Starikova:
IIRC spit fire is for MG/SG

Kyle:
<:OK:500692128058572800>

commie:
not if you hardcore corpse drag them

Kyle:
newer players wont be doingg that

CptHenry:
I don't remember what my newbie build was

commie:
2 days ago my G11 was at level 77, she's at 89 now :V

CptHenry:
I do know that it had Shrimp in it because I pulled her very early on

Luxanna:
Well

Luxanna:
12 levels in 2 days isnt a lot

Shmack (Salt Dog):
Max'd NTW.....and then IWS shows up

Luxanna:
And I am sure you got like 25 cores or so

Lilya Starikova:
how many AS val's did i cored for the past few months

ndfspro8901:
I put vector into that squad anything else i should change?

Lilya Starikova:

Shmack (Salt Dog):
*GODDAMNIT.MP3*

commie:

Lilya Starikova:

commie:

Luxanna:
From corpse dragging

Luxanna:
<@333624167280934912>shut up I dont need that info smh

Lilya Starikova:
:U

commie:
<@307521892963713024> what other ARs you got?

commie:
anyone else from the AR team? 4*s are easier to link than the 2 5*s you got

commie:
fucking asterisks

ndfspro8901:
I could try showing everything real quick

Luxanna:
<@307521892963713024> dont put vector in that team. It will make it everything worse.

Kyle:
wait people dont always burn val?

Ajss123:
skorpion would be a good alternative to vector for now to save on cores

Kyle:
i thought that was normal

Luxanna:
Id go for skorp instead of ump 9 and fnc / oats instead of 416

commie:
they do

CptHenry:
Some people like Val

Peppermint Tea:
Val is a normie waifu

Kyle:
i liked her a bit, then i heard her voice

Kyle:
<:RibBleeding:415391866822066176>

Lilya Starikova:
Don't Do Rage craft  for newbies

Peppermint Tea:
Val more like

Lilya Starikova:

Peppermint Tea:

Lilya Starikova:

Shmack (Salt Dog):
Ass lesson?

CptHenry:
I like raifus that aren't shy

Shmack (Salt Dog):
...go on

Shmack (Salt Dog):
<:hkStare2:414084643848192006>

CptHenry:
As I'm shy as well, so it makes everything awkward

commie:
rage crafting does bad things to your backside

Lilya Starikova:
>go rage craft as newbie

Luxanna:
>wait there are people who dont burn val

Lilya Starikova:
>kills RSC and luck

Shmack (Salt Dog):
Craft when drunk

Peppermint Tea:
>Ragecraft

Shmack (Salt Dog):
Always works

Peppermint Tea:
>Get poor on the long run

commie:
well last night I rage crafted

Kyle:
<@!223953631551029248> thats mildly disturbing

commie:
I realized I was trying to pull RFs with AR recipe

commie:
I pulled wa

Luxanna:
And speaking of normie waifus

CptHenry:
Rage crafting?

ndfspro8901:


Peppermint Tea:

Peppermint Tea:

commie:
man if I had half of this guys' luck I wouldn't complain about my life anymore üòê

CptHenry:
Neither is AK-47

Kyle:
i would just retire every one of those ak47s

Lilya Starikova:
Oh you know whats my 1st 5* pull

Lilya Starikova:
416

Shmack (Salt Dog):
Throw em in the TRAYASH

Luxanna:
Is tar supposed to be rare?

Kyle:
also famas is a little <:rhekaqualicious:427804806892224532>  compared to other ARs

CptHenry:
Scrap Bren and MG42 as well

Shmack (Salt Dog):
Tar is rare

commie:
TAR is rare-ish I think

Luxanna:
LOL

Lilya Starikova:
DO NOT SCRAP OATS 12

Shmack (Salt Dog):
her and g36 hardly show up

commie:
don't laugh at me, I don't have her

commie:
üò¶

Luxanna:
I cored something like 10 tars

CptHenry:
I still haven't got G36

Lilya Starikova:
aka Ots-12

Luxanna:
XD

Peppermint Tea:
Burn AK47, M1 Garand, Uzi, StG, MG42, Type88 and Bren  <@307521892963713024>

ndfspro8901:
Likejust retire em?

CptHenry:
Keep those M14s

Kyle:
yes

Lilya Starikova:
uh

Lilya Starikova:
to know about

ndfspro8901:
Okay

Lilya Starikova:
the maps you need to corpse drag

Chiaki:
if you're new, don't bother  with it for now. you need two strong dps and a tank

commie:
4-3E isn't that tough

commie:
he'll have to repair often but if it's resources that he is lacking...

Lilya Starikova:
Try 7-2E

Lilya Starikova:
:U

commie:
he can even do some kind of ghetto corpse dragging and just replace an SMG tank with another SMG tank

Luxanna:
I mean

Chiaki:
for now getting a squad to 70 is the goal

Luxanna:
Elphet is annoying as fucj

Luxanna:
Lets be honest

ndfspro8901:
Ive been trying to grip this game bit theres alot to grasp on it

Lilya Starikova:
Not for me <@!223953631551029248>

Luxanna:
She made me rage quit like 4 times

Shmack (Salt Dog):
Its actually pretty simple

commie:
what

Luxanna:
HAHA LETS FOCUS UR RIFLES HAHA

Lilya Starikova:
I just went Mow them with 2 MG 1 RF 1 HG and 1 SG

commie:
just use ARSMG 4Head

Shmack (Salt Dog):
The toughest part. Is throwing your dolls into an arena and having them fight to decide who can be worthy of an oath

Lilya Starikova:
^that's not necessary

Shmack (Salt Dog):
<:hkStare2:414084643848192006>  Its survival of the fittest

Lilya Starikova:
Smh

Lilya Starikova:
I oathed Fal and PTRD

commie:
you don't even need rifles to beat elphelt

Shmack (Salt Dog):
You.....ADULTEROUS

Shmack (Salt Dog):
*has 4 oaths*

commie:
her armor isn't that strong and AR SMG teams are less punished if your DPS is targeted

ndfspro8901:


commie:
after all, she procs her special move 2 times and you have 3 DPS :V

ndfspro8901:
Like thats my best team

Lilya Starikova:
have you tried

Lilya Starikova:
Enhance T-doll as well

Shmack (Salt Dog):
ah 416

ndfspro8901:
Yeah

Shmack (Salt Dog):
if you can

Shmack (Salt Dog):
try to use 416 with an offensive off tank

Shmack (Salt Dog):
Like a vector, sten etc

ndfspro8901:
I have vector and sten

Shmack (Salt Dog):
Use vector in front of 416

commie:
this guy has at least 4 times my luck at the start of this game üò†

ndfspro8901:
Im lvl 29 close to 30

commie:
all I pulled on my first few weeks was a kar

Shmack (Salt Dog):
Unless anyone disagrees, once you have vector and 416 in there you probably wouldn't need fal with em

Shmack (Salt Dog):
as you already have powerful nades

Shmack (Salt Dog):
HOWEVER

Shmack (Salt Dog):
416's takes forever to set off

commie:
elphelt is weak enough that any sufficiently levelled AR team with deal with her

Lilya Starikova:
OH hey

Lilya Starikova:
December 1

Shmack (Salt Dog):
The game is all about synergy, that's how you really get the gubbins

commie:
doesn't matter if it's FAL or anyone else, just level your strongest ARSMG to level 70, dummy link and destroy elephanto

ndfspro8901:
Like the ump sisters synergize surprisingly well together

Luxanna:
<@307521892963713024> that team is really bad for a beginner

Luxanna:
Cuz it's really expensieve to link

Lilya Starikova:
<@!223953631551029248>  i had worst tbh

Luxanna:
And you basically can't afford it

Lilya Starikova:
wanna see mine?

Luxanna:
Show

Lilya Starikova:
wait

commie:
my first team was AR team, RO635 and MP5 8)

Luxanna:
Mine was M4, tiddy95, skorp, ump45 and m14

ndfspro8901:
Ill see if i can make anything better

Luxanna:
I could afford 5* and 2 4h* cuz my 3* were free to link

commie:
tbf ndfs

Shmack (Salt Dog):
TFW you max'd out 416 oathed her n all that shit as she was your first 5 star waifu

commie:
you don't need to worry that much

Shmack (Salt Dog):
only to find out....there's better naders

commie:
getting enough cores for a 4x won't be a massive problem

Shmack (Salt Dog):
<:hkLewded:484732421485494272>

commie:
and it's 5x that's going to give you a headache, but you don't need 5x to clear elphelt well enough

CptHenry:
Are Type 95 & 97 worth farming for?

Lilya Starikova:
screenshots went missing so imma list em here 

my newbie build back then 

PTRD/M14/FAL/Mk23 and Thompson

Luxanna:
Tfw you maxed out and oathed vol cuz she is bae af <:BlobReach:414069175934386177>

Lilya Starikova:
and at that time it was in Operation cube

Shmack (Salt Dog):
oh Cube...

Luxanna:
<@333624167280934912> wat

Shmack (Salt Dog):
Remember when ourobouros was bugged?

Shmack (Salt Dog):
And would say lolfucku to your dodge tanks?

commie:
val worst raifu

Shmack (Salt Dog):
Ah good times

Luxanna:
>2 rf hg ar smg echelon

Luxanna:

Frabjous:
So I finally after months of search I got mk48 ama

Luxanna:

Shmack (Salt Dog):

Luxanna:
Mk48 is for furries

Lilya Starikova:
Funny That echelon i made beat it's ass through E 1-3

Lilya Starikova:
:U

Frabjous:
That

Shmack (Salt Dog):
<:hkStare2:414084643848192006>

Frabjous:
Makes no sense

Rheka:
lol my newbie build was mg3 BAR M4A1 Mk23 and Sten

Kyle:
the bright side with x5 is leveling slows down so much after 80

Lilya Starikova:
and when i make it to E 1-4 
the operation cube ended

Kyle:
gives time to build up cores

Lilya Starikova:
:U

suguri:
it's 410 base with 86 softcap and gets made up for by your 5x link at 90

suguri:
besides the main purpose is to get eq fodder and armor kills for weekly

suguri:
it's just also the least hassle for decent xp while satisfying both above requirements

Shmack (Salt Dog):
you ever hit a point

Shmack (Salt Dog):
where you have so many dolls you adore/want to use

Shmack (Salt Dog):
but not enough echelons

suguri:

suguri:
negotiating with mica to remove 1 doll from every other player's index and inventory except yours

suguri:
for $1 million usd

suguri:
on all current and future accounts

Luxanna:
Vols <:BlobReach:414069175934386177>

suguri:
yes vol you'd become the only player who can have vol

c3:
and probably also the only who would want to

Luxanna:
Pakyu

Luxanna:
<@307921946945781761>

ndfspro8901:
Anyone know if elphelt will be purchaseable at the end of the event?

Luxanna:
He also has vol <:BlobReach:414069175934386177>

Luxanna:
Also, vol mod 3 when. There is literally a modernised version of AS Val smh.

c3:
you either get her by clearing the event, or you don't

Luxanna:
<@307521892963713024> hwy would it be purchaseablw though? The event is quite easy

Luxanna:
There is no point in making her purchaseable

ndfspro8901:
Thing is, is that im struggling to catch up to the levels and i dont have much left to make my echelons stronger

commie:
eh you still have time, what are you lacking, resources?

Luxanna:
People who got her by grinding would be pissed and they wouldnt make a lot of profit on her

ndfspro8901:
Mostly recources

commie:
I wouldn't tbh

Luxanna:
TBH 11 days is enough to raise a sufficient rf hg echelon

commie:
>this guy just paid for what I got for free ayy

suguri:
desperation pays

Chiaki:
yeah 11 days is enough to raise a team

Chiaki:
just use the xp simulator a lot

Lilya Starikova:
i see people still whining about not beating elphet

ndfspro8901:
Im stuck on the mission before the elphelt battle

Lilya Starikova:
<:RibDiedInside:414195386199179265>

commie:
get to corpse dragging asap and you'll have enough of even an ARSMG echelon to beat elphelt

commie:
you don't need an S, just a clear on her

suguri:
11 days is 5 exp days

Lilya Starikova:
>arsmg

commie:
so even if your echelon is worse than the british expeditionary force after somme, you'll get elphelt

Lilya Starikova:
just use 3 RF 2 HG

Lilya Starikova:
T formation

Lilya Starikova:
:U

ndfspro8901:
How do you corpse drag? Im pretty new to the terms and strats to this game

Lilya Starikova:
you need

commie:

RFB at least has a niche

StrayedPath:

HazardousJay:

CptHenry:
And then I only got one Ribey xD

commie:
I dunno, you can use that last one on the 1doll echelon you use to resupply corpse draggers :^)

dropkick_tm:
I got rib but no zas

Sheodoq:
The closest we got to a machine gun from HOC

Sheodoq:
Just an automatic grenade launcher

commie:
was about to say that barrel looked a bit too thicc

Sheodoq:
40mm

Ashina:
Full auto sniper rifle

Sheodoq:
Or something

Ashina:
Germans made one

commie:
really?

Shiki:
Choroi would like to have a word

commie:
that seems really pointless for a sniper rifle

commie:
speaking of that, ironically one of the longest confirmed kills with a firearm was done with an M2HB

suguri:
hathcock was just something else

commie:
now think about the accuracy of that MG in this game :V

Yorihime:
Pointless because your gun will be unreliable

Shiki:
No one seem to be bothered that m2hb logging around a mounted mg all by herself

Yorihime:
But fun for videogames

Sheodoq:
She's a machine why couldn't she?

she's just very strong ok

Shiki:
Choroi log around both the gun and the platform tho

Ashina:
NTW can carry NTW

Sheodoq:
You mean a MG?

Ashina:
M2hb can carry her gun

Yorihime:
MG in the game can carry both ammo and gun

Ashina:
Remember

Ashina:
They're robots

commie:
but what if they start breaking the laws of physics

Vinen:
Phyisics

Yorihime:
If you carry a pistol your anti materiel rifle becomes a machine gun capable of downing everything

Vinen:
in a game with Alien Tech

commie:
don't ask me though, I'm not a scientist

suguri:
g11 needs to violate 1st law to be as good as she is

Shiki:
Then we have sop and 416 shooting grenade outta thinair <:SOPMODfunnyfeic:427804752701554719>

Shiki:
Their guns have no launcher

suguri:
they shoot it out of their arms like nano

suguri:
<:SOPMODfunnyfeic:427804752701554719>

suguri:
except it's a grenade and not a roll cake

Vinen:
Sop shoots it out of her mouth <:SOPwao:465878170046955521>

commie:
huh, I always imagined they were firing rifle grenades

commie:
though I haven't been paying much attention to the animation itself

suguri:
their guns don't actually have the launcher attachment

commie:
they arm a hand grenade, carefully place it on the muzzle and fire a live round to launch it

suguri:
also m16 is using a m4

suguri:


Ashina:

Shiki:
Mg3 4 5 dont act like sister though

Shiki:
They dont even acknowledge each other

HazardousJay:
MG3 will most likely look at MG42

HazardousJay:
since MG3 is just a 7.62 MG42

commie:
mg3 is not close to the mg4 and mg5 designs

HazardousJay:
reminds me of that one 4koma featuring those 3. lol

Nihilo:

there was only the e-peen medal

Just in terms of challenge really.

Although you lot can worry about that in your own time.

Kitsune:

Chiaki:

Kitsune:

Kitsune:
<:SOPMODfunnyfeic:427804752701554719>

Kitsune:
tbf hydras aren't so bad, my WASVD can deal with them

Ashina:
Can we do a surgery on a IDW

art12345:
Btw what is this idw thing

art12345:
The 2 star smg cat?

commie:
a top tier smg

commie:
she's kind of rare

Ashina:
I still want to known if there's a

commie:
that's why people meme a lot about her

Ashina:
What does it called

Ashina:
The spring?

Kitsune:
don't be a troll pls

Ashina:
Spring in the back

FlueneCha:
IDW's anni costume is top tier

Kitsune:
IDW is a 2* SMG, she's subpar

Ashina:
Its on modded 3 idw

Kitsune:
she does get a MOD3, but she's still meh

art12345:
Ah

commie:
someone tried to argue for evasion buffs on the backline in here before

commie:
ü§î

FlueneCha:
Her anniversary costume makes up for it

FlueneCha:
<:SOPMODfunnyfeic:427804752701554719>

Kitsune:
outclassed still by C-MS(although comparing her to C-MS is unfair as hell) and MP7

Ashina:
When a 2* is more useful than a 3 star

Ashina:
Uzi

Ashina:
Hanyang

c3:
>lemming

Chiaki:
she's already outclassed by shipka <:thonk9:410657576892497930>

commie:
but even then, is shipka really worth using?

Chiaki:
i mean...

Ashina:
Seriously Hanyang has the most health of all rifles

commie:
half of her buff is IDW already

Kitsune:
i mentioned common SMG choices

Kitsune:
sry

commie:
10% evasion on ARs

commie:
if you want evasion on ARs, might as well use idw for the 20% :V

Ashina:
+50% accuracy for SMG

Siege Waifus:
I was memeing back then, I wasn't actually serious on advocating for IDW usage

Ashina:
SMG stands for Small Machine Gun

FlueneCha:
Sure

Ashina:
Anyways guys, today I purged all of my 2* dolls

Kitsune:

Sheodoq:

Vinen:

WetRagz:
What is HOC?

Vinen:
what is HOC anyhow.  Is there a page I can read up on them?

Vinen:
I know its far future content

WetRagz:
And why is it H O X Y . . . ?

commie:
yeah I've been told so, but for late starters we just want things that accelerate our early/mid game

Sheodoq:
Think ATGMs, heavy weapon emplacements etc

Sheodoq:
Mortar pools and shit

Sheodoq:
I want my artillery batteries

WetRagz:
So, what, Heavy Ordinance teams?

SleepyDuck:
even with that 80% attack boost and 40% acc boost

SleepyDuck:
oof

Kitsune:
she has her own niche since she becomes an RF

Kitsune:
in terms of targeting

Slave to the Caffeine:
yeah shes more useful than homete

c3:
her dps isn't bad, but nothing outstanding on it's own. question is just whether you have use for her gimmick

Slave to the Caffeine:
even if weaker

suguri:
homete can't change target priority to jaegers

Slave to the Caffeine:
which is always useful

c3:
by the time her skill activates, you've already eaten the first jaeger volleys though

Slave to the Caffeine:
or morters

Kitsune:

Kitsune:
<:RibBleeding:415391866822066176>

AlliedG üá¨üáß:
<a:triggeredField:427811541455470602>

FlueneCha:
RFB scales harder with RoF

Chiaki:
using rfb for djmax paradropping jaegers is a mistake since her skill has starting cd

FlueneCha:
<:SOPMODfunnyfeic:427804752701554719>

CptHenry:
Bwuh

c3:
if I have issues with jaegers, I'd put a single rof rf in the team and call it quits, not rfb

Chiaki:
same

c3:
<:OK:500692128058572800>

Kzar:
same

Kzar:
or just drop in with MG and murderize them

Ashina:
All of the member of this team is drawn by the same person

Ashina:
<:BlobReach:414069175934386177>

FlueneCha:
The thing with RFB is that she is an AR and you might want to build and ARSMG squad with her

c3:
it kind of shows

c3:
I might not, thanks, but I'll be taking that t91 until 9a special equip makes it's way here

Kitsune:
are y'all prepared to rank DD

c3:
probably

Having a D is already hurt

it was so bad, wasn't it

Chiaki:
some goofs happened

Chiaki:
it was fun <:OK:500692128058572800>

Kitsune:
straight up since i forgot how to kite

Kitsune:
someone sent me a tutorial

Kitsune:
that was why there was such a great amount of downtime

Chiaki:
more like some enemies required some ridiculous kiting and others were residentsleeper

Kitsune:
i was watching it on my other screen

Chiaki:
like the manticores ree

Kitsune:
i think i have the hang of it now

Kitsune:
the manticore with the IWS hybrid + taunt lmao

Kitsune:
ngl i'm still baffled at my decision to use MG4 instead of any other MG

noremacc:
Wtf

Ashina:
Is it me or every time I see my Thompson it reminds me of raz from VC4

Ashina:
"Any of you have a lighter?" Says Thompson as she sit down, surrounded by sangvis ferri vespids

How does fairy works

Chiaki:

Ashina:
Alright no need to tell me

commie:

hopefully the cafe will solve my thirst for some lore

it's basically doll backgrounds, less actual world building, imo

Mmmyes. Cafe will be a good implementation. Cause the game has talked about the Cafe in Tips for a very, very long time. While it never made sense since it didn't exist at the time.

unless you want to equate one with the other

i just want my barista springfield skin

no more no less

Cafe introduces several elements. A section for PVs, and section for Comics, a section for digmind related stories, and last section for Costume related story sets

Nah. They should appear. I did something, like sorting them by rarity. They appeared at bottom.......????

did you check their equipments?

AR15 with blk bullet is pretty much already high tier

BlackBird:
by default any tdoll with level appears in the bottom (default sorting settings)

H·∫Øc (TosylChloride):
to see whether they're carrying any locked pieces or not

Jazaia Taizago:
Were not carrying locked things. Just common stuff.

Jazaia Taizago:
Finally! Removed...more space for other ones.

H·∫Øc (TosylChloride):
how did you do it

Following a form of Guide List to help me a bit sorting stuff out and understanding what's on the red/yellow/blue list.

they do not want to be discarded.

oh btw thoughts on this?

Her costume yeah

the doll annihilator you defeat isn't elphelt herself

Jazaia Taizago:
If i'm to deduct from information in the past tense discussion regarding this. Yes. There may be.......some sort of method you will get relevant T-Dolls from SF.

FlueneCha:
I meant as in owning a SF doll

Jazaia Taizago:
-shrugs- How that works or etc. I have no flying idea.

FlueneCha:
The real Elphelt is the one FN rescues

Jazaia Taizago:
There was a heavy discussion on reddit at some point about this.

FlueneCha:
But if you use the costume your Elphelt becomes a SF Doll

FlueneCha:
So...

c3:
that really only works if you want to treat a costume as a seperate kind of doll and that's just mental gymnastics

Jazaia Taizago:
Initially. SF's T-Dolls are technically more advanced then the ones we have now.

Magical Spicy Lyrical Green Tea:
if you want to contend for the worst tasting ones

Kane:
I could live on MREs if they didnt either clog you up or flush you out

Kane:
Lotta the powder shakes are said to flush fuickers out good, though Ive never had it happen

Magical Spicy Lyrical Green Tea:
problem is, rations are designed around that principle

Kane:
<:minkFAL:410657215486230528>

Magical Spicy Lyrical Green Tea:
tiny package full of your daily needs and sometimes more

Kane:

Magical Spicy Lyrical Green Tea:
the trick is not to eat the whole set in a day

Magical Spicy Lyrical Green Tea:

Lilya Starikova:

Lilya Starikova:
TY 99 pcs of it

Toni07 (KeikoATR72):
Yeah

Toni07 (KeikoATR72):
Im still doing it tho

Toni07 (KeikoATR72):
26 pulls so far

Toni07 (KeikoATR72):
Its low because im rather busy

Lilya Starikova:
now i need to resources

Toni07 (KeikoATR72):
<:karlicious:414085222217416705>

Toni07 (KeikoATR72):
And even worse

Toni07 (KeikoATR72):
I cant get S-rank on the final boss

Toni07 (KeikoATR72):
You know which one

Toni07 (KeikoATR72):
Need explosive ammo?

AsherP:
Do you set your echelons to x formation when they reach the boss panel?

Toni07 (KeikoATR72):
Well

Toni07 (KeikoATR72):
Im just do the boss node once tho

Toni07 (KeikoATR72):
Got her at the second try

AsherP:
I don't bother with the boss level

AsherP:
it's a pain

AsherP:
takes waaaay too long for just one seithr

Toni07 (KeikoATR72):
My echelon formation might be üöÆ enough...

Strela:
bloody hell I want to retreat my targetted unit but I swapped them instead <:SOPMODfunnyfeic:427804752701554719>

Strela:
RIP S rank

Toni07 (KeikoATR72):
Btw, tips for the boss node?

Toni07 (KeikoATR72):
The final one seems hard

Toni07 (KeikoATR72):
Two tried to beat her

Toni07 (KeikoATR72):
One with general team (didnt know that the boss is armored)

AsherP:
I think you still have time to reach 99 seithrs with obtaining 8 on a daily basis.

Toni07 (KeikoATR72):
Second with revised team (2MGs included)

Strela:
don't MG lol

Toni07 (KeikoATR72):
<:karlicious:414085222217416705>

Strela:
they are too slow to form X

Strela:
either arsmg, or RFHG without cape

AsherP:
I use the AR/SMG but i'd sometimes get something other than an S

Strela:
the moment you see they are targetted, retreat that unit

Strela:
if you retreat after she used the skill that's too late

AsherP:
lol done that but still get poor result

AsherP:
xd

Toni07 (KeikoATR72):
Retreat?

Toni07 (KeikoATR72):
Move them to different position?

Strela:
press that unit and withdraw

Toni07 (KeikoATR72):
Oh

Toni07 (KeikoATR72):
But...

Toni07 (KeikoATR72):
Still possible to S rank with retreat?

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
yes

Toni07 (KeikoATR72):
ü§î

Strela:
yeah

Strela:
even with 1 died it still possible to s rank

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
S rank is calculated by the damage you took

Strela:
as long as the others aren't that damaged

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
if you retreat the damage is considered 0

AsherP:

LoneWalker:
Doesn't matter cause ar15s art style looks great any ways

deadlymessenger:
her school outfit used to be incapable of reaching maximum RoF for some strange reason

HazardousJay:
was hoping to get at elast MG4's uniform from those

HazardousJay:

don't remember if this was fixed

LoneWalker:
Let's hope it's fixed cause I'm not changing her anytime soon <:SOPMODfunnyfeic:427804752701554719>

KnockFan:
That's like some jank unfixing.  Like Mu-12 skin skill thingy.

HazardousJay:
i mean, AR-15's school shooter outfit has a good shelf-life anyway before mod 3 comes

HazardousJay:

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:

The Laughing Man:
Plus a maxed HV ammo

Arcus:
It's not much, then you remember her skill is x2.8 firepower

Actias Luna:
+8 damage is a lot of damage. >_>

Actias Luna:
Just in general.

Arcus:
And it's ontop of night vision

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
+8 dmg is a lot considering it's a PEQ

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
I see no minus

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
just plus

Rin:
there is no disadvantage to using it

Rin:
other than upgrading it loses you resources I guess

Arcus:
I mean, it's enough to buff her FP to be competitive with Groza

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
no I don't think so

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
yet

Rin:
groza pushes above both of them

Rin:
in reality 9a91 and t91 is around even

Arcus:
groza has 50 FP

Arcus:
Talking about base FP

Rin:
I'm pretty sure though

Arcus:
under skill groza still wins

Rin:
9a91 will overtake groza

Rin:
If ringed

Rin:
It's pretty close

Chaotix:
oh god the pudate preview

Arcus:
T91's advantage is her skill lasts slightly longer

Chaotix:


Arcus:
oh no

Cryolock:

Rin:

Mg4 is rare than Negev?

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
screw collection

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:

Shatterstar Nova:

Pungey:
So including L2D suomi

Sheodoq:
idk weapons testing?

Sheodoq:
Jupiter cannons always need live targets

Sheodoq:
like local villages and civilians c:

Slave to the Caffeine:
pfft

Slave to the Caffeine:
no more like trying to make him a weapon..

Slave to the Caffeine:
"Well we have this human, lets at least make him useful"

Sheodoq:
oh perfect use the Elphelt event

Slave to the Caffeine:
"SCIENCE"

Sheodoq:
they converted Elphelt to a weaponized doll

Sheodoq:
just say they're trying to use it on him

Slave to the Caffeine:
..

Slave to the Caffeine:
you are a fucking genius

Sheodoq:
it even worked

Sheodoq:
so yeah should fit in just fine

YoRHa K7 Ê∏ÖÂß´ ‚öôüêâ:
wait wtf

YoRHa K7 Ê∏ÖÂß´ ‚öôüêâ:

C4Cypher:
"local teen attempting to take upskirt photos of maido detained by SF security forces"

Sheodoq:
trying to go full Asanagi on SF

SaturnDay:
what an intellectual conversation

Aydensnake:
>S.T.A.L.K.E.R takes place in Ukraine
>SF is in Ukraine
Do you guys think a stalker has ever tried to infiltrate SF's main facility?

Sheodoq:
where do you think the Brain Scorcher is üòâ

20thSentryFox:
Well, we obviously haven't heard back from the guy

20thSentryFox:
<:Huaji:414068953615171584>

Sheodoq:
Strelok is Shikkikan

Aydensnake:
Also, S.T.A.L.K.E.R collab when?

Sheodoq:
the Zone would probably the Collapse fluid hellscape I guess

Sheodoq:
be the*

Sheodoq:
as Stalker DOES have zombies that use guns

NO

Sheodoq:
I hear that too much

HazardousJay:
***POP IN SOME TIME, IT CAN BE FUN AROUND HERE***

Sheodoq:
god I can hear his accent and everything

3SJay1:
Did someone say

3SJay1:
poi?

HazardousJay:
no, poi

Aydensnake:
We need more S.T.A.L.K.E.R x GFL art or fanfics

HazardousJay:
SF vs Monolith

HazardousJay:
<:thonk9:410657576892497930>

Sheodoq:
to be honest you could probably merge some of the Stalker and GFL universe together

Aydensnake:
Yeah, it'd mesh pretty damn well

Sheodoq:
except that Russia and the US are dead basically

HazardousJay:
i mean,. sure SF has the tech advantage.. but do they have the fanatical zeal of Monolith? <:thonk9:410657576892497930>

HazardousJay:
that and freakin' **GAUSS RIFLES**

Sheodoq:
I was thinking SF controls the brain scorcher and Elisa is trying to control it and stuff

Aydensnake:

Sheodoq:

Sheodoq:

HazardousJay:
ngl, never got to use the gauss rifle much in CoP lol

Aydensnake:
But seriously, we need a S.T.A.L.K.E.R crossover

Sheodoq:
it was too expensive to really use

HazardousJay:
very strong, but yeah, expensive to use, it was made even more absurdly expensive in MISERY

Sheodoq:
but now we can ignore that as we only need food and ammo

Sheodoq:
oh yeah I played Misery

Sheodoq:
naked man with a knife and shotgun kills local boars the game

HazardousJay:
lmfao

Sheodoq:
no joke it's actually very profitable to go fully naked and buy a knife and a shotgun

Sheodoq:
call it "shikkikan's wild ride"

Sheodoq:
just hunt boars and jump on rocks

Sheodoq:
ez game ez life

HazardousJay:
true, never really bothered with armor that much there, since you are still squishy as hell and the NPC's can still easily kill you anyway lol

HazardousJay:
of course, until late game, where you need the SEVA suit

Sheodoq:
Misery is the only stalker game where you're almost forced to never sprint because you can;t

HazardousJay:
though it becomes bearable with carbon steel plates and flame artifact <:OK:500692128058572800>

Slave to the Caffeine:
that would be insinuating isekai are as bad as Noel

Slave to the Caffeine:
and thats just not true

Slave to the Caffeine:
<:sealSmug:414085422277328896>

Axylum:
haha...

Sheodoq:
at this point the only isekai I liked was Overlord

Sheodoq:
papa bones is always entertaining

Slave to the Caffeine:
overlord has been great.. theres another one i cant remember the name of cause the name is dumb

Slave to the Caffeine:
but the MC is DEMON LORD DIABLO

Sheodoq:
oh yeah that one lol

Slave to the Caffeine:
and its pretty fucking great

Sheodoq:
it only gets lewder

Slave to the Caffeine:
i either like isekais that go in weird directions (Overlord)

Slave to the Caffeine:
or ones that you could never take seriously (that one)

C4Cypher:
The Devil Is A Part Timer?

Sheodoq:
shikkikan goes on an adventure after an SF supply convoy accidentally rams him

C4Cypher:
_is stubbornly writing his own isekai fic_

Slave to the Caffeine:
i actually am writing an isekai GFL fic

Sheodoq:
does shikkikan get isekai'd or does someone get isekai'd?

Sheodoq:
someone else*

Slave to the Caffeine:
someone gets isekai'd into GFL

Sheodoq:
"Local teen commits numerous war crimes"

Slave to the Caffeine:
in this case though its the

Sheodoq:
"I didn't know they were civilians"

Slave to the Caffeine:
teleported to another world rather than waking up as someone else

Slave to the Caffeine:
unfortunately.. this is in an SF base

Sheodoq:
"Local teen gets shot up by SF aggressors"

Slave to the Caffeine:
Local teen gets murdered by an over powered maid

Sheodoq:
going to be hard to explain how a teen infiltrated an SF stronghold

Slave to the Caffeine:
he didnt

Slave to the Caffeine:
litterally was dropped right into the center of it

Sheodoq:
na I meant if he got caught

Sheodoq:
"I just happened to appear in your motor pool honest!"

Slave to the Caffeine:
oh he falls on top of Eliza

Slave to the Caffeine:
is the best part

Slave to the Caffeine:
Agent doesnt like this

Sheodoq:
just immediately drops in

Slave to the Caffeine:
.. i forget is it Eliza or Elisa

Negev:


Sheodoq:
does a hard dab

Sheodoq:
then runs

Slave to the Caffeine:
im trying to think where to go from there

Sheodoq:
what's the story aiming for anyways?

C4Cypher:
I am intrigued

Slave to the Caffeine:
im sorta winging it

Sheodoq:
"Local teen dicks down SF aggressors"

Slave to the Caffeine:
its more fun that way

Sheodoq:
ah

c3:


C4Cypher:
Heh, as if I wasn't winging my own fic.

Slave to the Caffeine:

Slave to the Caffeine:

Sheodoq:
and they planned Singularity for next year fall

Slave to the Caffeine:
while being an isekai

Sheodoq:

Sheodoq:
it's a SF base how would you have comms in a Griffon base?

C4Cypher:
Let me know when you publish

Slave to the Caffeine:
he eventually ends up in Griffon

Sheodoq:
wait just have P7's Dinergate actually be an infiltrated spy

Slave to the Caffeine:
the entire SF thing is more "A reason for him to dislike them"

Kfish:
y tf tdolls cute

Kfish:
<:SOPwao:465878170046955521>

Slave to the Caffeine:
but whatever this is only a very lose base

C4Cypher:
Pfft, my MC gets gutted by a guard 30 sec after waking up

C4Cypher:
that's plenty reason

Sheodoq:
isn't the point of an isekai to have fun :p

Slave to the Caffeine:

H·∫Øc (TosylChloride):
it kinda surprises me that Thunder was designed as a HG, but not a semi-auto AR
the 50 BMG was so large for the HG platform that she had to be designed as a single-shot breech loader, like artillery pieces 
but I think that the round can definitely work in a magazine-fed gas piston semi-auto AR

H·∫Øc (TosylChloride):
the larger gun frame would most likely allow a magazine feed
sure she may become larger than most ARs, but the difference wouldn't be as monstrous as with the HG variant

Rggcd:
i guess the designers were just going for "haha 50 bmg handgun"

why do you need spare energy for mod 3? mass powerlevelling?

Vinen:
My luck has been garbage

Aly:
Mass memory fragment farming

Aly:
You need an assload of those and the sim only gives 60 at best

Des:
uh oh

Des:
i guess theres still a year to hoard though lul

The Laughing Man:
They should just release memory frag combat sim early

The Laughing Man:
Rather than wait till MOD comes out

Aly:
Ehhhh

Aly:
It makes no sense

c3:

The Laughing Man:
I do it once on Monday and Thursday

c3:
on non-data ofc

Vinen:

Vinen:
Too many tickets

Vinen:
Not worth it

c3:

Shatterstar Nova:
or b-rated yahoo games

commie:
I know a lot of people who don't even play games at all

Vinen:
No less than 8 teslas parked near me car lel

Des:
nobody else at work plays any games other than me out of the ~300 workers in my fleet

commie:
it's really strange, computer games are one thing but not wanting even a mobile game to kill a bit of time?

Des:
its construction workers they are either on tinder/pof or trying to score something recreational

Shatterstar Nova:
or reading shitty social media posts

Des:
I guess yeah on insta

Shatterstar Nova:
WHAT ARE YOU EXPECTING

Des:
those sheep scrolling through the same 40 insta posts all day im truly ascended

Des:
as i grind 4-3E another 300 times

Shatterstar Nova:
go to a rural or remote regional area

Des:
haha how can they do something so repetitive

Shatterstar Nova:

Des:

Des:
I noticed that the manga is a cross collab with kadokawa though so it shouldn't be super insane to see cospa velcro hook loop patches

Des:

The Laughing Man:
He's probably gone forever

Aly:
Yeah draa said the content pace is just too slow

Aly:
He‚Äôs gone now

Aly:

Aly:
Maybe one day he‚Äôll return

Siege Waifus:
Tommy gun, no question about it

The Laughing Man:
If he returns, he'll quit 5mins later cause he didn't get Elphelt

Des:
what does he mean by content pace being too slow

Aly:
Exactly as it sounds

Des:
oh no

Aly:
The speed of new content is too slow.

The Laughing Man:
Release of events is too slow

The Laughing Man:
Wait...he quit 15 days ago

The Laughing Man:
Which was right after rate up

Aly:
Oof

commie:
5 days before our current event

The Laughing Man:
Maybe he ragequit cause he didn't get shit

Des:
was he an NA player?

Aly:
Inb4 contender killed him

Aly:
Yeah

Aly:
He was really dedicated when the game first came out.

Aly:
He‚Äôs like number 9 on DD leaderboard

art12345:
american looking

Des:
the only dedication ive done so far is 100% every event on NA

That‚Äôs not exactly hard

yeah you'll need to repair somewhat often, depending on RNG

Kyle:
it works decently well

commie:
but overall you should be able to squeeze out 2 runs at the very least

commie:
3 runs are possible

besides, you don't lose affection on bosses

august99us:

august99us:
but is there any reason you really really really need those 5 cores right now?

commie:
I dropped 1 on a random seithr a few days ago and I don't need any more noels

commie:
hm

commie:
good question

Kyle:
you need 10 noels

Kyle:
one to lead each echelon into battle

commie:


JohnTitor:
Use like

commie:
this might be a good answer to that question

JohnTitor:
4 teams

JohnTitor:
That are just Noel

JohnTitor:
<:homete:410658578014273538>

august99us:
yeah, but do you really need those girls to be linked right now?

august99us:
we have no content

august99us:
there's no reason to rush linking

commie:
if you could use the same dolls on one single echelon maybe a 5x noel meme team would be amusing to look at

commie:
hm, take a guess at how many complete echelons I have, that is, at least 5 5x dolls

Kyle:
get them all to 0 closeness and then just let them rot in storage

august99us:
why does it matter how many complete echelons you have

commie:
but even then, what need does one have for multiple noels?

august99us:
<:homeThonk:484732324198744097>

Kyle:
it would make me feel good

Kyle:
to have full echelons of 100 x5

august99us:
it's not like we have anything that even remotely requires complete echelons atm

JohnTitor:
Imagine like

Kyle:
gotta be prepared

JohnTitor:
Teams that are like

commie:
he's trying to get rid of the competition for when we get the content

JohnTitor:
Double SVD

commie:
oof

JohnTitor:
Or double Wawa

august99us:
apparently you still have like half a year to "get prepared" <:homeThonk:484732324198744097>

how ready are you for future content?

suguri:

no

suguri:

JohnTitor:
Not at all

august99us:
how ready am i?

commie:
yeah

Kyle:
x5 her then burn her

august99us:
not completely ready

Kyle:
get her hopes up then drop her

august99us:
i only have like 5 mg teams leveled

JohnTitor:
I dont even have a single full squad

commie:
hm curious

commie:


commie:


commie:
perhaps I am somewhat behind

Kyle:
still ahead of me

Kyle:
<:roCry:414084703323160576>

that's because I've been grinding somewhat hard :V

august99us:
who cares

suguri:
<:SOPMODfunnyfeic:427804752701554719>

Kyle:
im slowing down a lot bc exp is so slow after 75

commie:
are you trying to grind 4-3E after 75?

c3:
üôè

Kyle:
and i cant rush bc i'll be out of cores if i do lol

commie:
you should move to 5-4E or 0-2 tbh

Kyle:
ive been doing 0-2 some

Kyle:
is 5-4e good?

c3:
or you can just 4-3e to 100

Kyle:
im assuming easier than 0-2

suguri:
it's fine to keep doing 4-3e until at least 84

commie:
5-4E gives good exp because bosses give double exp

Kyle:
oh didnt know that

c3:
5-4e is rushing desutroyer

Kyle:
ill try it out

commie:
it really depends on if it's feasible

suguri:
since the -20% exp dropoff is covered by the extra link from 70

commie:
give it a try and see how well you can do the boss

august99us:
https://puu.sh/C9PQ1/cd334ea51b.png <:SOPMODfunnyfeic:427804752701554719>

suguri:
staying in 4-3e any longer than that isn't worth unless you're a cultist though

Kyle:
my main echelon is more geared towards bosses than 0-2

commie:
oof

Kyle:
so that might work

commie:
a dozen MGs but the guy who doesn't have even a 5x link MG should watch for his cores

suguri:
you see aug the difference between you and I

suguri:
look at the top right

august99us:
i'm a casual

august99us:
ok

august99us:
yea but where are you on tdoll ranks <:sealSmug:414085422277328896>

commie:
<@!224026360794841099> what you need for 5-4E is a good evasion tank, but from my experience you'll probably need to quick repair every 2 or 3 runs, depending on RNG

suguri:
97

suguri:
<:SOPMODfunnyfeic:427804752701554719>

august99us:
<:mk48LUL:500681251733110785>

suguri:
I was 58 right after contender batch

suguri:
<:roCry:414084703323160576>

commie:
it's heavier on quick repair tickets than 4-3E but if you need full teams for 0-2, 0-2 would probably require repairs after 2 or 3 runs

august99us:
actually kinda surprised

suguri:
it's not really constructed dolls though

august99us:
97 is 145

suguri:
it's the lack of limited dolls farming

suguri:
<:g36Lazy:481469060589027329>

august99us:
you should go farm them

suguri:

Siege Waifus:
But DP-28 out damages LWMMG everytime I use them~

Huey Springfield:
some secret plot?

SleepyDuck:
on what planet does DP-28 out DPS anything

HazardousJay:
depends on the mobs i guess, are they evenly leveled though

SleepyDuck:
HAHAHAHA

ü§£

HazardousJay:
and equips too

Siege Waifus:
on my planet I guess

Huey Springfield:
I dont care much about the monthly Doll anw, most of them I keep just for collection, but in this case gotta say it is a bit unfair

Siege Waifus:
like, they are both on the same echelon, have the same equips, buffed by the same hg and sg, and DP-28 consistently out-damages LWMMG at the same level

suguri:
there are a couple of good monthly dolls

SleepyDuck:
wellll

SleepyDuck:
DP-28 out DP's LWMMG after like

SleepyDuck:
12 seconds

SleepyDuck:
basically after 2nd reload

suguri:
6p, type 59, type 65, sm-1

SleepyDuck:
which is basically useless

SleepyDuck:
LWMMG only out DPS's DP-28 during her first reload

<@154053022014504961> read the event info

ShadedExalt:
Could also potentially be IMI Jericho 941, AKA the ‚ÄúBaby Eagle‚Äù and Spike‚Äôs gun

Cammerhammer:
It would make sense to be Jericho

commie:
I mean, from what you can see, it can be either since the grip design between the two is really similar

commie:
and when it comes to proportions...

Cammerhammer:
They teased her for a while

commie:
well just ask kar98k's artist

commie:
:V

H·∫Øc (TosylChloride):
I've just translated Thunder's Children's Day lines

man does she sound depressing

Arcus:
kar's offscaling is the exception that proves the rule though

Arcus:
also definitely intentional

Cammerhammer:
There's a lot of offscaled dolls

ShadedExalt:
C h i l d  a b u s e

Cammerhammer:
P7

commie:
P7 is just really big

commie:
can't fault someone for getting assigned a tiny gun compared to your titanic size

ShadedExalt:
7‚Äô shitty loli that will use up your whole spice cabinet and dab on you

Cammerhammer:
Gigantic cat loli nun

ShadedExalt:
Bruh no wonder MP5 was intimidated

Arcus:
P7 and Makarov are both smol pistols

ShadedExalt:
Seeing as how MP5 is just over 4‚Äô

ShadedExalt:
Makarov isn‚Äôt 7‚Äô tall tho

Arcus:
She isn't though

Arcus:
The pistol is just small

ShadedExalt:
S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Call of Pripyat

ShadedExalt:
Makarov as Honourary PMm Major Degtyarev starts with

Arcus:
it's only 16cm long

AsherP:
WOAH

AsherP:
IS THAT DEAGLE

Arcus:
Consider that the average length of a person's head is around twenty something-ish cm

commie:
no

commie:
is not deagle

AsherP:
oh

H·∫Øc (TosylChloride):
wait, does Thunder actually have wings?

ShadedExalt:
*it COULD be Deagle

Arcus:

Shiki:
Where is my

Shiki:
Ak74

Arcus:
when has that ever been helpful

Arcus:
ever

ShadedExalt:
Never

HazardousJay:
bog standard AK-74 pls

HazardousJay:
shame we only get the krinkov :/

ShadedExalt:
Anyway <@!192808094160519168> it could be Desert Eagle, or it could be Jericho 941

ShadedExalt:
But the 941 is the Baby Eagle anyway, so

AsherP:
Likely to be a 941

c3:
we'll get aks-74, that's gotta be good enough for you

commie:
>folding stocks

HazardousJay:
i mean.. theres ots-12 too i guess, she's just a 9x39 AKS-74U

HazardousJay:
also for some reason im sure someone is gonna make a cowboy bebop reference with the jericho lol

ShadedExalt:
Give Strelok's rifle

HazardousJay:
SG-550?

HazardousJay:
<:SOPwao:465878170046955521>

ShadedExalt:
SIG SG 550

HazardousJay:
yee

Arcus:
so

ShadedExalt:
Alternately give DShK

Arcus:
another CZ 75 clone

Arcus:
:V

ShadedExalt:
CZ75 is a pistol

Arcus:
I

Arcus:
I was talking about Jericho

ShadedExalt:
SIG SG 550 is an assault rifle

Arcus:
Not SIG

ShadedExalt:
Make that clear then 'cause I was confused as hell

Arcus:
Hmm though speaking of SIG and pistols

Arcus:
will we get a SIG pistol one day

HazardousJay:
i mean.. theres M2HB, so a DShK wont hurt

ShadedExalt:
P226 when

HazardousJay:
or i guess a NSVT if they want to be more modern

ShadedExalt:
<@!307921946945781761> That's what I mean, give M2 some competition

HazardousJay:
even stronker

ShadedExalt:
M2 > DShK IRL, IMO

ShadedExalt:
But in game, that's the best option yeah

ShadedExalt:
Give buff big titty Russian doll that blushes when called by nickname

HazardousJay:
dushka

ShadedExalt:
Because Dushka is it's nickname, which means a dear or beloved person

Eluchel:
When should I use the X exosuit as compared to the T exosuit on SMGs?

ShadedExalt:
You shouldn't

HazardousJay:
on arsonists

ShadedExalt:
Unless molotov doll or Shrimp

HazardousJay:
give the X series to the Arsons/Grenadiers

ShadedExalt:
Or it's the best you have

Arcus:
Dolls that need the damage

Arcus:
Currently that just means grenadiers, arsonists, and shrimp

ShadedExalt:
For example, I have 1 Gold T-Exo and that's on 45, so 9 gets one of my Gold Xs

Arcus:
Later we get a few more damage dealers

Arcus:
The thing about Gold X though

ShadedExalt:
Because gold X is better than green T

Arcus:
Only at +10 though

Eluchel:
Ok, thanks!

Arcus:
Or actually no

Arcus:
But you need to enhance quite a bit

Arcus:
And it's only slightly better

ShadedExalt:
Nah, my green Ts are actually shitty and the Xs were better basically out the gate

ShadedExalt:
Why would you bother enhancing greens

commie:
hm, what's AR70 good for?

commie:
at least her grenade doesn't look too bad

commie:
her tile is kind of ass but if you go full meme she might be good for shrimp?

c3:
as a log-in doll, my bet would be that she's good for cores

commie:
at a first glance she doesn't seem that bad actually

commie:
same damage stat as soppo but with 11x grenade damage instead of 12x

commie:
she also gives 75% accuracy plus 12% rof, but she has a bad layout that forces you to either put her in the middle (and no AR buffer) or use shrimp as main tank

c3:
if you need a dedicated nader for a dedicated shrimp squad, go ahead then, I guess

Arcus:
her problem is that you don't really need another AR grenadier

c3:
<:hkStare:414084643994992640> is all you need

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
just go shredder

Arcus:
And she gets outmuscled by the competition

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
use team shredder like me

commie:
heckler and koch? heck

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
and your shrimp is good

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
<:RibBleeding:415391866822066176> üëå

Arcus:
just give shrimp a gold scope

Vinen:
<:RibBleeding:415391866822066176>

Arcus:
better than accuracy buff tiles on terrible base accuracy

c3:
why not both.jpg

commie:
but muh crits

Arcus:
well then

Arcus:
hmm

Arcus:
no crit buffers for SMGs other than 40 I think

Arcus:
But honestly you don't need crits anyway if you're instead buffing Shrimp with FP up tiles

[SB] The Yuri Guy:
AR70 seems decent for a Shrimp team

Arcus:
Eh

Arcus:
I think crits are basically 1.5x damage?

Arcus:
Or something like that

commie:
2AR 2HG for buff shrimp

commie:
just shrimp

Arcus:
Can't remember the actual multiplier

Pacbough:
normally 1.5x

Arcus:
So yeah just stack FP and ROF buffs instead

Arcus:
Or you know

Arcus:
Get UMP40 to buff her

commie:
just get ump40 4Head

Arcus:
Once UMP40 comes out

Arcus:
that is

Sparkee100:

somerandom101person:

AlliedG üá¨üáß:

somerandom101person:
Why is there some sound delay on nox app player?

~sopposilver~:
prolly mem leak

~sopposilver~:
not sure tho i dont use emulators

~sopposilver~:
might want to ask in <#410790982116966400>

~sopposilver~:
<:OK:500692128058572800>

c3:
I'm on nox too and don't remember ever encountering something like this

Chiaki:
never happened to me

~sopposilver~:
~~maybe hes a potato?~~

c3:
allocate more resources or upgrade your rig?

Chiaki:
i know it's a trash "works on my machine" answer but i'm legitimately surprised

c3:
ditto

~sopposilver~:
oh its a sound delay?

~sopposilver~:
<:fncFat:502098769379196928> ya i got no clue

Slave to the Caffeine:
<@403166336861208576> have you tried restarting nox?

Slave to the Caffeine:
it does start to have sound problems after its been on for a while

c3:
another meme reply that's actually unironic

somerandom101person:
No setting changes?

~sopposilver~:
the classic answer

Slave to the Caffeine:
delayed sounds or playing them at half speed

somerandom101person:
Should I do on 30 fps?

c3:
nox does tend to run into issues if you leave gfl running for too long, forcing you to restart every once in a while

Slave to the Caffeine:
is a thing ive encountered from it being active for extended periods

Slave to the Caffeine:
yeah pretty much

Slave to the Caffeine:
yeah no setting changes yet

Slave to the Caffeine:
just restart it

c3:
for me it's graphical bugs, like black models, I've seen

Slave to the Caffeine:
ive had that too

Slave to the Caffeine:
usually the sound problems come first

Elphelt Valentine:
i play GFL on Nox b4

2 hours straight

works pretty well.

somerandom101person:
Still has sound delay.

somerandom101person:
Does 60 fps cap made the sound delay?

c3:
I run at 60 and no issues

c3:
by all means try since you have nothing to lose, but I'm starting to think it might really be your system/ rsc allocation

~sopposilver~:
does 60 frames even do anything for gfl?

~sopposilver~:
the game runs at 30 does it not?

c3:
if memory serves, yes

~sopposilver~:
hmm?

~sopposilver~:
what would it even do? <:homeThonk:484732324198744097>

c3:
no clue, but it was the default option and my system definitely has the power, so why change it

c3:

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:

Shu:

Atokani:

Shu:

Shu:

ExESGO:
I dont whale as hard lah

Shu:
Smart man

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
1 RoF buff 1 FP buff 1 bamboo

Shatterstar Nova:
it may seems like i know what im talking about, i actually don't.

Shatterstar Nova:
<:toot:414068992114688003>

Shu:
Nice

noremacc:
i dont think u need a separate welrod for bamboo

noremacc:
but idk

Atokani:
bruh

Atokani:
it's on you

noremacc:
well

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
welrod makes bamboo-ing much easier

noremacc:
bamboo doesnt even use welrod though

Shu:
I don‚Äôt have a bamboo squad so I wouldn‚Äôt know  ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

Shatterstar Nova:
welrod pkp clear battle in 3-4 sec

Shu:
Hmmm

noremacc:
u dont really need to make a separate squad for it

noremacc:
just use the damage hgs and like

noremacc:
springfield mosin

noremacc:
since its kind of like a utility thing

Shu:
Nah rather use a 5 star to flex

noremacc:
if u have them

noremacc:
then u can use those i guess

Shu:
Only good bamboo is ntw

Shu:
Don‚Äôt have bunny loli yet

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
M99 as well

Shatterstar Nova:
as long as you don't go 3 rf, you're fine

Shatterstar Nova:
<:toot:414068992114688003>

Shu:
I know

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
I only dupe the ones I need

Shu:
I need bunny loli

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
I'd rather not take the discount

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
only do when I can't get my hands on a dupe

noremacc:
would u guys dupe grizzly

Atokani:
yes

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
I have 3 grizzlies

Shu:
Yeah

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
3 ump45s

Atokani:
yes

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
and I have no problem with it

Shu:
Ump45 is S tier

Atokani:
she's the most solid smg tank right now so i dont see why not

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
ump45's tile buff is one of a kind

Shu:
She‚Äôs got tier

noremacc:
isnt there a better smg later?

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
so duping her is a must for me

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
nope

Shu:
No

Atokani:
no lol

noremacc:
hm

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
nothing can match her lol

Shu:
Because she gets an exo later which makes her more op

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
she's one of a kind

noremacc:
oh right

noremacc:
the exo

noremacc:
plus the mod 3 later i guess

Shu:
Exactly

Shu:
S tier

Atokani:
mod 3 doesnt change much tbh but still an upgrade

noremacc:
i mean

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
you can't even find a more solid SMG

noremacc:
it help keep her position more secure

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
and I have 4 AR-SMG teams

Shu:
You got shrimp

Shu:
But she‚Äôs an off tank

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
would not mind using 4 ump45s

Atokani:
shrimp competes with other offtanks

noremacc:
u dont dupe ars though right

noremacc:
id hope not lol

noremacc:
dupe g11

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
I have 2 hometes tho

Shu:
Shrimp is basically ar smg

Shu:
Lol

noremacc:
ok thats really pointless lol

Shu:
Homete

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
both lvl 100

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
SL10

Shu:
It‚Äôs not tho

noremacc:
shes very average

noremacc:
idk

ExESGO:
Time to get my pity Noel today

Shu:
Cuz she‚Äôs like the only smg that can do damage

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
*look at vector*

noremacc:
i was tlaking about 2 hometes

Atokani:
other than miss pyromaniac

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
<:thonk9:410657576892497930>

Shu:
No she‚Äôs good for shrimp squad

Shu:
Like mine

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
dmg SMGs are mostly off-tank

Atokani:
2 hometes is up to personal preference because people wouldnt stop the doggy meme

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
and I needed an AR that could fit the bottom tile

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
with balanced stat

Shatterstar Nova:
remember only demented people go with 3 rf

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
homete fits the bill

Shu:
And vector is good for clearing trash

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
don't even mention green homete

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
she's inferior

Shu:
She‚Äôs alright

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:


IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
unfortunately

Shu:
Yeah

noremacc:
the 3 other dudes

noremacc:
lwmmg crew

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
LWMMG mk48 negev?

noremacc:
thats enough for like 3 teams already

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
then that should be fine

noremacc:
i have negev too but shes not really used for htat

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
just leave a dupe

noremacc:
1919

noremacc:
is one of them

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
corpse drag it and leave it for when you need

Atokani:
just keep a dupe of big 4 for future content

noremacc:
is there anything else i should dupe

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
big 4

noremacc:
i hear hgs

noremacc:
but im not really sure why

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
HGs

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
for HGs you might wanna dupe mk23

Atokani:
big 4, some HGs

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
welrods

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
calicos

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
stechkins

Atokani:
you can never have enough HG buffs

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
hoxy

noremacc:
what do u ever need spare welrod for

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
lol nvm hoxy

Shiki:


IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
all HGRF teams need welrod

noremacc:
when u can just use makarov for the 2nd hgrf team

noremacc:
difference is kind of small

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
makarov is just dicount rod

Atokani:
*kind of*

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
why settle for the discount

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
when you can get the full one

noremacc:
because

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
<:YES:427808453868781568>

M4 SOPMOD II MOD III:
So many died insides <:ump40Ehe:414074434035515392>

noremacc:
im going to level 1 of every gun anyways

noremacc:
so i already have makarov leveled

noremacc:
why level a spare welrod

noremacc:
for a small boost

Atokani:
that's on you lol

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
depends on you

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
I'd rather go for a dupe welrod

noremacc:
i get that calico cant be replaced

noremacc:
basically

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
than makarov

noremacc:
but idk

Atokani:
on you tbh, since on paper leveling a dupe is a better choice any way

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
actually

noremacc:
i mean

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
calico can be replaced by astrea IIRC

noremacc:
feels so marginal

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
but weaker

noremacc:
well

noremacc:
the difference between astra and calico

Atokani:
if it's so marginal then why not go for a full package

noremacc:
is a bit larger than welrod and makarov

Atokani:
it goes either way

noremacc:
see

noremacc:
if thats the case

noremacc:
only level dupes

noremacc:
lol

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
it's up to you, tbh

Atokani:
since you prefer leveling each and every doll, it's more convenient for you to go for makarov

Atokani:
but for everyone else, i'd still recommend going for the dupe

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
I prefer dupes since welrod benefits much better for me

Atokani:
ü§∑

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
but I can't force you

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
ü§∑

noremacc:
do you really not have a makarov leveled though?

deadlymessenger:
whether to use dupes or not is a personal preference choice

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
I don't need a leveled makarov if I have 3 leveled welrods

deadlymessenger:
personally I see really do see this as a collection game and I refuse to use dupe dolls

Atokani:
same

noremacc:
why do u even need 3

noremacc:
lol

Shatterstar Nova:


deadlymessenger:
there can be only 1 pikachu

Atokani:
same reason above

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
cuz I have 3 HGRF squads

Atokani:
for the buff

noremacc:
3 squads

noremacc:
do u dupe the uh

noremacc:
rfs

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
no

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
3 squads

noremacc:
or is it just 1 exodia 1 heavy and 1 rof

Shu:
Oof

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
3 different types

Shu:
Y‚Äôall mind if I flex ?

noremacc:
go ahead

Atokani:
there are so many viable RFs that i dont think you should dupe

Shu:
Lol

noremacc:
lol

noremacc:
so many

noremacc:
theres like 5

Shatterstar Nova:
as long as you're using 2 rf 3 hg

Shatterstar Nova:
you're fine on ephelt

Shatterstar Nova:

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
you can

noremacc:
with the planning mode

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
you only need to move in boss fight

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
the rest is just

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
set up

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
and do something else

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
route is fixed

ChikenTheBaka:
I just do it on impulse while watching a video now

noremacc:

noremacc:
since u can only do 2 a day

noremacc:
i feel like its a pain to set up my guns

noremacc:
lol

noremacc:
im not gonna farm it when i basically get a noel for free anyways

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
just leave 1 team for event

ChikenTheBaka:
^

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
the rest can be derpy as much as you want

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
since they don't need to do much

noremacc:
for the rest of the maps i just use my corpse dragging echs

noremacc:
lol

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
lol

Shatterstar Nova:
tell every level 50 newb commander to use 3hg 2rf team

noremacc:
lol

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
by the time you reach lvl 50

Shatterstar Nova:
*gets shit on by ephlet really hard*

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
you wouldn't be a newb anyway

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
lvl 50 should have a lvl 100 or two squads

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
all good

+Neptune+ (Lawyer-san):
It's ezpz

enerdjysk:
im not sure why but i cannot afk kill elphbet with full HGRF

enerdjysk:
so instead of welrod im using m16 XD

+Neptune+ (Lawyer-san):
<:suomiNANI:414084644322017280>

enerdjysk:
dunno could it be bcz of welrod not lvl100

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
no that's not it

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
which formation are you using

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
and where are you putting them

enerdjysk:
well classic hgrf

enerdjysk:
svd wa2k 950a

enerdjysk:

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:

Elphelt eats Ps for breakfast

The Laughing Man:
You need to change it to
XOX
OXO

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
not really needed

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
move 1 HG to the front row

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
when the battle begins

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
then afk

enerdjysk:
im too lazy to switch them

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
but then that's not afk

enerdjysk:
i mean

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
<:thonk9:410657576892497930>

enerdjysk:
i can

The Laughing Man:
You can make X formation your default formation

enerdjysk:
XOO
XXX
XOO

enerdjysk:
and this are clear map for me

enerdjysk:
while im just need to give them orders

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
X formation is more for people without sufficient firepower

enerdjysk:
with m16

enerdjysk:
not needed to switch anything

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
so they might want to minimize damage

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
with X formation

enerdjysk:
this one

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
you just need to move 1 HG forward as soon as possible

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
eh....

enerdjysk:
do not change anything

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
not sure but

enerdjysk:
since map starts

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
won't that

enerdjysk:
and clears just fine

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
make SVD aim at elphelt first?

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
alone?

enerdjysk:
no

enerdjysk:
elphelt

enerdjysk:
do not even fire

The Laughing Man:
<:SOPMODfunnyfeic:427804752701554719>

enerdjysk:
she dies before invul frames

The Laughing Man:
If that works for you then go for it

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
of course that's the aim

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
but oh well

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
still need to grind IWS a bit more

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
before bringing her to combat

Shatterstar Nova:
"i'm doable"

+Neptune+ (Lawyer-san):
Unless the one way paths can be switched through

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
no?

+Neptune+ (Lawyer-san):
I'm not seeing how it'd work

ChikenTheBaka:
For which one nep?

+Neptune+ (Lawyer-san):
Then no, it's a 5 turn map

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
I do 4 turns everyday nep

ChikenTheBaka:
Since its easily doable with 4 turns on ephelt

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
4 turn is all it's needed

+Neptune+ (Lawyer-san):
Can you show your route

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
gimme the map

+Neptune+ (Lawyer-san):
Because every time I do it I can see my main echelon attacked before resupp and empty

+Neptune+ (Lawyer-san):
Ergo the plan fails

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
no worry

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
your main squad won't get attacked

+Neptune+ (Lawyer-san):
So I hold back as I get resupp and a five turn clear

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
in fact

+Neptune+ (Lawyer-san):
But they do

+Neptune+ (Lawyer-san):
Errytime

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
nothing can touch you

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
if you follow 4 turn route

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
just write this down since I suck at drawing

+Neptune+ (Lawyer-san):
The enemy movements mean they always will be

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
turn 1: sub squad 1 at HQ, kill 2 enemies on the left of HQ, spawn sub squad 2
main squad at lower helipad, kill the nemy above the helipad - end turn 1

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
turn 2: main squad moves to the far right helipad, you'll get 3 fights, end turn 2

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
if you follow what I did on turn 1 you get 5 APs

+Neptune+ (Lawyer-san):
Hmm

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
which is enough to move

+Neptune+ (Lawyer-san):
Aight it's the opening that's different

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
turn 3: supply, main squad moves to top helipad,

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
from there you move straight to boss in turn 4

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
with 5 fights

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
done

+Neptune+ (Lawyer-san):
I'll give that a whirl

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
you need to take off the capes if you HGRF tho

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
since enemies are mostly mortar shooter

+Neptune+ (Lawyer-san):
Nah I'm using smgar with guard squad as sgmg

+Neptune+ (Lawyer-san):
Mortars? They die too quick

+Neptune+ (Lawyer-san):
To hit me

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
if you use capes you take a while to reach enemies

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
so you might get hit

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
you triggered damage?

<:thonk9:410657576892497930>

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
*insert that's a lot of damage meme here*

Hecate:
Does moving tdolls somehow distract Elphelt, therefore preventing her from entering immune mode too soon and fire nuke...?

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
no?

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
if you move T-dolls forward your firing range increase

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
you deal damage to her faster

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
that's all

Hecate:
Isnt Elphelt starts at firing range already

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
nope

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
the fight starts with mobs at firing range

gundams

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
*but they are considered smol boss?*

Kitsune:
etc etc

Slave to the Caffeine:
other than like dinergate swarms its good at everything

Kitsune:
they're not bosses though

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
hence the smol

nguuuquaaa:
pretty sure bosses have 50% and 25% nuke which renders IWS useless

Slave to the Caffeine:
no..

Kitsune:
you can run M4/IWS later on

Kitsune:
for general use

Slave to the Caffeine:
that doesnt make her useless

Kitsune:
and bossing

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
how do you even build M4/IWS team

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
<:thonk9:410657576892497930>

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
still can't figure out the formation

Kitsune:
M4 IWS 3HG

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
what do the HGs buff

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
dmg or RoF?

Slave to the Caffeine:
you place it so M$ and IWS get all the ROF buffs

Slave to the Caffeine:
then retreat the 3 hgs

Slave to the Caffeine:
and use mod3 m4s skill

Slave to the Caffeine:
and nuke everything

Kitsune:
you only need to retreat two

Slave to the Caffeine:
oh right its 2 not 3

Kitsune:
m4's skill activates on 3 left

Kitsune:
so you could keep contender or something on to tank

Kitsune:
and kite

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
so it's hoxy, calico and welrod

Slave to the Caffeine:
contender over welrod generally

Slave to the Caffeine:
for that

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
doesn't contender focus fire the team?

Sheodoq:
I hope M16 gets the same op treatment

Sheodoq:
Yeah

Slave to the Caffeine:
only if you use her skill

Sheodoq:
But M4 is AOE and IWS is death so should be ok

Slave to the Caffeine:
which should be on manual anyway

Nico Yazawa, Otonokizaka Idol:

Slave to the Caffeine:
PPK

Hya:
>not having 5-7 <:Huaji:414068953615171584>

Kitsune:

Hya:

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:

Kitsune:

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:

Slave to the Caffeine:
stechkins already in it

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
but that team is only for bossing

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
mobbing is

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
.......

Kitsune:
ppk, yeah

Nico Yazawa, Otonokizaka Idol:
Ah

Kitsune:
'only for bossin'

Slave to the Caffeine:
mobbing is just use SVD + Wa eche

Kitsune:

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:

Slave to the Caffeine:
i mean

Kitsune:
hydras

Kitsune:
manticores

Kyle:

Marv Singer:
the devs should add the Lahti-Saloranta M/26 xD

Kyle:
not waifu enough so i havent used her myself

nexusnuva:
Who should I swap out?

nexusnuva:
To level t95

nexusnuva:
To level more stuff

Kyle:
yep really good, her damage stat is great

Kyle:
hm

The Laughing Man:
Probably swap out 416

The Laughing Man:
Or FAL

Kyle:
grenades arent that necessary for corpse running

nexusnuva:
And finally get ~~Ithaca's rival in tit size~~ elphelt

Kyle:
in 4-3e

nexusnuva:
Corpse running?

Kyle:
oh  were you going for general team

nexusnuva:
I'm just leveling normally tho

nexusnuva:
Yea

Kyle:
regardless type 95 is still great

Kyle:
good pick to level

nexusnuva:
I'm just using this team as a way to level her quickly

nexusnuva:
No seriously who should I swap out

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
> grenades aren't good for corpse running

nexusnuva:
I'll probably change it back after she gets up to speed

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
you mostly run 0-2 corpse drag with grenades tho

Kyle:
i dont feel like you need them very much on 4-3e

Kyle:
thats why i added 4-3e

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
ah 4-3e

Kyle:
bc yeah theyre amazing for 0-2

nexusnuva:
I said I'm not corpse dragging yet

Kyle:
my secondary team with a bunch of grenades does better than my much stronger conventional squad

Kyle:
on 0-2

nexusnuva:
I don't have a reliable dps

Kyle:
yeah

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
where's AR team

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
<:thonk9:410657576892497930>

nexusnuva:
I'm just farming

Kyle:
well type 95 is good dps right <@!197917022623891466>

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
yeah

Kyle:
cool

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
she's a good dps with sustainable dmg

nexusnuva:
YEAH THATS WHY IM TRYNA LEVEL HER

Kyle:
would you say 95 or 97 is better

Kyle:
or about the same

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
about the same

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
depends on the buffs

Kyle:
oh fuck

nexusnuva:
Forget it >_>

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
95 is slightly better

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
but only slightly

Kyle:
just killed my being carried team accidentally

Kyle:
rip echelon 4

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
I'm having a 95 97 team

Kyle:
in exp sim

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
95 receives 2 buffs from the SMGs

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
but 97 still wins

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
occasionally

Rheka:
Twintail is better sister

Kyle:
agreed

Kyle:
she doesnt need abnormally huge tracts of land either

Kyle:
<:umpOwO:500681384226979840>

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
<:g11spit:410657877825683456>

Kyle:

Kyle:

Kyle:
<:hkStare2:414084643848192006>

Ashina:

nexusnuva:
Uhhhh

nexusnuva:
I just swap out one of the ar with m16

nexusnuva:
And farm like normal?

nexusnuva:
Idk man I'm very confused rn

Pacbough:
you can drag on 4-3e

Pacbough:
use 1 dps + 1 smg tank and 3 dolls to level +1 dps on another echelon

Kyle:
yeah m16 is for 02

august99us:
why this shikikan love nagan grandma

Kyle:
4-3e is a much lower bar

Kyle:
and is good exp till the 70s

nexusnuva:
Should I use fal as DPS?

Kyle:
she does ok

nexusnuva:
Hmm

Kyle:
should be fine imo

august99us:
not for 4-3e

august99us:
lol

august99us:
just use star + m4

nexusnuva:
>_>

Kyle:
do you have g11 or one of the type sisters

nexusnuva:
Type sisters?

Kyle:
97 or 95

nexusnuva:
No lol

nexusnuva:
Neither

nexusnuva:
~~come home beepo~~

august99us:
you must have star and m4

Kyle:
yeah that should be fine

nexusnuva:
So basically

nexusnuva:
More leveling.

Kyle:
yup

august99us:
did you expect anything else ^^

nexusnuva:
ahhhhhhhh

Kyle:
the grind will never end

august99us:
this game has no other content

nexusnuva:
I don't have enough AMMO

nexusnuva:
I don't even have a 5th echelon ffs

Kyle:
üëÄ

Kyle:
shouldve boughtthe shit out of those with all yo crystals asap

Kyle:
i will admit i bought some for extra echelons early on though

nexusnuva:
I don't have enough jams

Kyle:
it helps a lot

nexusnuva:
NO JAMS

Kyle:
having 4 logistics running at all times is great

nexusnuva:
Still

Kyle:
take out a loan and buy crystals

nexusnuva:
NO JAMS

Kyle:
donee

nexusnuva:
lol

nexusnuva:
Do you even realize

nexusnuva:
You are taking to a 15 yo who has no access to his bank account

nexusnuva:
Nada

nexusnuva:
Nothin

nexusnuva:
Whatevers in there

nexusnuva:
I can't use it

Kyle:
i didnt

Kyle:
rip

nexusnuva:
<:rhekaqualicious:427804806892224532> I guess the only solution to that is logins

Kyle:
<:SOPMODfunnyfeic:427804752701554719>

nexusnuva:
300 jams in da bank

nexusnuva:
I just need 180 more

Kyle:
yeah you can get a couple eventually

Kyle:
this might not be the best time to mention though

Kyle:
after the first it jumps up to 880

nexusnuva:
FUCK

Kyle:
to unlock the rest of them

nexusnuva:
NO

Kyle:
it doesnt increase past that though

nexusnuva:
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

nexusnuva:
oh

nexusnuva:
THANK GOD

Kyle:
yeah

Kyle:
unless unlocking the 10th is extra

Kyle:
bc up to 9 its still 880

Kyle:
but at that point its whatever

nexusnuva:
Wait

nexusnuva:
How many can you get?

Kyle:
10

nexusnuva:
Oh

Kyle:
so plenty

nexusnuva:
I thought 8 this whole time

Kyle:
8's enough for pretty much everything though

Kyle:
4 logistics, 2-3 for doing whatever

Kyle:
1 autobattle

nexusnuva:
You know what

nexusnuva:
I'm just gonna put swap out one of my ars for star

nexusnuva:
And level her

nexusnuva:
And run outta ammo

nexusnuva:
But it should work

nexusnuva:
Wait what is the other alternative?

Kyle:
you didnt level star

nexusnuva:
The type sisters?

Kyle:
but shes ‚ù§

Kyle:
g11 is good dps

nexusnuva:
95 and 97 right

Kyle:
both type 97 and 95 are good too

Kyle:
but theyre all 5*

Kyle:
im sure theres more but im just going off of what i have

nexusnuva:
I might have her lying around somewhere in the dorm

nexusnuva:
Holl up

nexusnuva:
Yea

nexusnuva:
I have ~~big boobie ar~~ 95

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
make no mistake

nexusnuva:
Hmmmm

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
that's not honkai impact

nexusnuva:
I confuse

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
that's guns girl z

The Laughing Man:
It's the prequel to Honkai

Kyle:
lol

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
not really prequel

Kyle:
wait that already happened?

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
just "another timeline"

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
yeah

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
already did

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:

Kyle:

Kyle:

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:

Kyle:
üò≠

Kyle:
the one time i actually would know the characters

The Laughing Man:
I want Seele

Kyle:
same

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
you won't get her

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
never

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
that won't happen

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
need to be straight

The Laughing Man:
Why you gotta be such a downer

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
because I am from mihoyo side

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
originally

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
I know

nexusnuva:
Can ppk tank?

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
barely

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
she has very high eva

nexusnuva:
>_>

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
but very low HP

nexusnuva:
Soooooooo

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
if you equip her with gold exo

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
and gold silencer

nexusnuva:
I still have to swap her ass with welrod

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
boosting her eva to 140-ish

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
then yes you can

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
<:thonk9:410657576892497930>

Kyle:
how does evasion work?

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
and she can too

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
"miss"

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
that's all?

Kyle:
is it just flat taken off of their accuracy

Kyle:
to give the chance to hit

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
chance to take hit

Kyle:
yeah but i know they can go over 100%

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
take off enemy's accuracy is another formula

Kyle:
how high does enemy accuracy go?

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
they can't go over 100%

Kyle:
i thought they could

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
100 is the stat

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
not 100%

nexusnuva:
Even if it were possible it wouldn't matter

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
boss's cut-ins can't miss anyway

nexusnuva:
Wait

nexusnuva:
Should I start doing corpse dragging

nexusnuva:
I mean

nexusnuva:
I'm a lazy fuck

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
are you

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
strong enough

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
to drag?

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
you need M16 at lvl 80+

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
and 2 dps at lvl 100

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
with high dmg

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
and good skill at lvl 10

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
to be efficient

nexusnuva:
Well

nexusnuva:
Idk if this is high enough

nexusnuva:
I can swap them out for deadweight hgs

nexusnuva:
And farm on a stage I guess

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
where's M16?

nexusnuva:
Wait

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
<:thonk9:410657576892497930>

nexusnuva:
I need m16

nexusnuva:
FUCK

nexusnuva:
More farming for meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee

nexusnuva:
AGH

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:

Pacbough:
you dont't need m16 to drag on 4-3e

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
but

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
0-2 drag

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
<:roCry:414084703323160576>

nexusnuva:
I forgot about 0-2

nexusnuva:
Lol

Pacbough:
drag on 4-3e with m16 until leveled üôè

nexusnuva:
No

nexusnuva:
That ain't working

nexusnuva:
I didn't even TOUCH m16

nexusnuva:
Jesus

Pacbough:

Chaotix:

nexusnuva:
CHRIST

Pacbough:

Pacbough:

nexusnuva:
So basically

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:

nexusnuva:
So we can rush b

McSparky:
"The Vodka annihilators"

hoyahaihai:

nexusnuva:
I was sort of disappointed when I realised the Collab only had elphelt and Noel in the story

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
it's expected

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
I wanted susan too

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
<:roCry:414084703323160576>

Kyle:
to be fair most collabs in gacha games only have 2-3 people to get

nexusnuva:
Considering how many people in GG had GIANT PECKS

Kyle:

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
ggz had 5

nexusnuva:
Ggz?

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:

Kyle:

Kyle:
üëÄ

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
you might not need to swap

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
if your RFs are strong enough

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
"if"

nexusnuva:
Fun fact

nexusnuva:
They arent

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
seems like it

Kyle:
fun fact, the creater of spongebob passed away yesterday

Kyle:
i guess not so fun

nexusnuva:
Rip

Ignius Kagami:
Why is the Data Dorm Room still using a typewriter when we have better technologies?

SaNiTYs EnD:
Ok I don[ want to spam it but how bout stechkin, Makarov, mk23, Enfield and m14?

Kyle:
because typewriters are VINTAGE

nexusnuva:
Because JOKES

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
no mechanical keyboards

Cabbage:
Nothing is better than the typewriter

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
shame on kalina

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
git gud plz

Kyle:
i mean we use welrod all the time

Kyle:
and thats an old, unwieldy gun

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
eh....

Cabbage:
That's like saying the trebuchet isn't the greatest seige weapon in the world

nexusnuva:
But in gfl

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
makarov is fine

Kyle:
but its cool

dropkick_tm:
<@!260974273659797504> better tech my butt, they still have folders there

Hecate:
This is vintage game. Isnt it

nexusnuva:
Welrod reins supreme

Hecate:
Vintage guns too

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
but if you are using lee and m14

Kyle:
nothings wrong with folders

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
no need for mk23

Kyle:
get yourself a manila folder to plan vacations

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
you want to focus on buffing RoF instead

Kyle:
<:sealSmug:414085422277328896>

Ignius Kagami:
Folders are common in high tech areas too

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
so lee m14 calico welrod and stechkin/hoxy

nexusnuva:
Mk23?

dropkick_tm:
Folders are old fashioned dude

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
would be the ideal formation

nexusnuva:
You mean Calico?

SaNiTYs EnD:

dropkick_tm:

nexusnuva:
My ppk isn't that good

Kyle:
i mean you can *beat* elphelt with any not horrible team at level 100

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
I'm saying you can use ppk

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
this team clearly overkills

SaNiTYs EnD:
I dont have FN five 7

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
use stechkin

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
she can replace 5-7

SaNiTYs EnD:
Ok cool Ill level them hard

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
I used stechkin in place of 5-7

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
worked even better

nexusnuva:
Liek dis?

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:

nexusnuva:
Aight

nexusnuva:
Now

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
but 10k <:thonk9:410657576892497930>

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
you might wanna level a bit more

nexusnuva:
And that's the only problem.

nexusnuva:
ACH

nexusnuva:
*GAG*

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
yeah recommended x4

Vinen:
<@295469985873002496> stop lewding welrod

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
for all

Vinen:
<:RodTime:484729471728091147>

nexusnuva:
Blame bunny

nexusnuva:
Stupid elphelt

nexusnuva:
Ripping people apart with her

nexusnuva:
"MACHINE GUN"

HazardousJay:
this squad fucks up elphelt pretty good, can do it with minimal damage easy

nexusnuva:
Thinkin she's all cool

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
<:welrodWhat:500693278484725772>

nexusnuva:
Pshhhhh

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
I name that squad

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
"look ma, no 5 star"

nexusnuva:
Lol

nexusnuva:
Look ma

nexusnuva:
I broke the meta

McSparky:
I was thinking, almost all ruskies

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
vladimir ivanokovic ivan team

HazardousJay:
thats my intention lol

McSparky:
Oh my God no, o got it

HazardousJay:
all russkie Rifle HG squad

nexusnuva:
THIS IS TEAM WE USE TO KILL BLYAT

Cammerhammer:
Honestly I used NTW for shits and giggles a couple times

Cammerhammer:
And it was so much work

Shu:
I know

Cammerhammer:
Because if she did too much damage before her skill activated Elphelt popped shield

skaianDestiny:
>how do you go 3RF
you dont

Shu:
Either way I need to make a Bamboo squad

Shu:
After I‚Äôm done with my lmg squad

skaianDestiny:
if youve got mosin springfield and her are small bamboo

Shu:
Nah I‚Äôll make a big bamboo

nexusnuva:
Yeahhhhhh fuck elphelt

nexusnuva:
I still don't know how to dodge genoverse

LoneWalker:
withdraw or force shield

Cammerhammer:
That's why you move your handguns up front

nexusnuva:
Yeah

nexusnuva:
I did

Cammerhammer:
So your rifles are out of range

nexusnuva:
I did the fucking X formation

Cammerhammer:
Hmm

Shu:
Lmao

Shu:
At least you beat her

nexusnuva:
Yeah

nexusnuva:
Still no s

nexusnuva:
Still no seithr

Shu:
Oof

Shu:
Rip

nexusnuva:
If I was just aiming to beat her I would just use my 3ar2smg team

SaNiTYs EnD:
I just get wreaked in elphet my 11k squad just dead in seconds doesn't matter if Dodge her skill or not

nexusnuva:
What's your team?

SaNiTYs EnD:
Gimme a sec

SaNiTYs EnD:


Kyle:
armor is whats fucking you

Kyle:
how're the grenade launcher abilities doing in terms of damage

nexusnuva:
(X) doubt <:RibDiedInside:414195386199179265>

SaNiTYs EnD:
Pretty good I get her down to the larger part in hp but that's all she goes yeah x form when round starts

Kyle:
i mean tbh i would just say commit since you are getting close

Kyle:
just level a bit more, get everyone to x4

nexusnuva:
Commit to?

Kyle:
your current team

Kyle:
unless you have a RF near the same levels

nexusnuva:
Or.....

august99us:
<:homeThonk:484732324198744097>

SaNiTYs EnD:
Yeah i been leveling all day, just hoping I can spam her level at the end to get her

nexusnuva:
I could just try again with my fking 90+ arsmg team

Cabbage:
<:g36Lazy:481469060589027329>

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
bamboo against elphelt

SaNiTYs EnD:
I dont have any rf that high yet

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
is unneeded

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
and risky

nexusnuva:
Then should I swap her out for Lee?

nexusnuva:
I could go for wazooo

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
lee + M14

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
good enough combo

nexusnuva:
But that would be MORE LEVELING

Kyle:
yeah

Kyle:
im able to do it with wawa and m14

Kyle:
at 70-80

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
well you have to level anyway

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
can't avoid it

Kyle:
the reason why i suggested for sanity to keep working on their current team is just because of newer player struggles

nexusnuva:
Then should I make an ech with a more reliable tank

SaNiTYs EnD:
I dont have wa

Kyle:
no cores, hard to corpse drag effectively

Kyle:
im basically the same just a week ahead

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
tbh

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
3 HG 2RF

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
is reliable enough

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
to down elphelt

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
but you need dummy link

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
skill level

Kyle:
yeah but since HGs arent great for new players, many wont have good ones leveled

Kyle:
for example i can make a kick ass HG RF squad but i dont have the cores to do it

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
since HGs buff RFs and you might need your RFs sufficiently buffed

SaNiTYs EnD:
<@197917022623891466> I have a 2 hg 3 rf ech should I definitely level them?

nexusnuva:
Should I swap something out for maybe smg or even sg

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
don't level that kind of echelon

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
3HG 2RF only

nexusnuva:
<:suomiNANI:414084644322017280>

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
unles

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
unless

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
the RFs are carcano

nexusnuva:
Oh you're talking to sanity

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
which we don't have right now

Kyle:
buff the two RF to high heaven with sexy HG buffs

nexusnuva:
No seriously

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
yeah that mommy M14 team seems ok

Kyle:
leveling a RF just to put in for general use as you go through story levels is pretty useful though

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
but

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
5-7 at lvl 49

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
<:thonk9:410657576892497930>

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
not gonna be easy

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
<:thonk9:410657576892497930>

nexusnuva:
I wanna swap out something for smg or sg for more reliable farming

nexusnuva:
Because it's me

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
don't bring any SG

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
in that team

nexusnuva:
And I forget to SWITCH CALICO AND WELRODS POSITIONS ALL THE DAMN TIME

nexusnuva:
GOD.

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
tbh

nexusnuva:
WHY AM I LIKE THIS

Kyle:
calico too high maintenance

Shu:
Me neither

nexusnuva:
<:karlicious:414085222217416705> you learn something new everyday.

Shu:
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

Shu:
Send me you‚Äôre squads

Cammerhammer:
Who, me?

Shu:
Both

Cammerhammer:
Ah

Shiki:
no, mine

Shu:
Hmmm

Cammerhammer:
I used these three to clear E-4

Shu:
Ohh

Cammerhammer:
Top one is for killing Elphelt

Shu:
Interesting

art12345:
um

art12345:
how easily did you destroy elephant

Shu:
You don‚Äôt have an ar squad ?

Cammerhammer:
AR squad is the middle one

Cammerhammer:
Also no, that's not my main AR squad

Shu:
Ohh

Cammerhammer:
That's number three-ish

art12345:
wait isn't noel bad

nexusnuva:
Elephant

Shu:
Didn‚Äôt noticed lol

Cammerhammer:
Noel is bad, yes

Cammerhammer:
I'm letting her hang out with the cool kids though

Shu:
Yeah that‚Äôs what everyone says

Shu:
Lol

Cammerhammer:
I don't need a super powerful echelon to hold the middle points

nexusnuva:
Should this be enough to deck elphelt in the face

Cammerhammer:
That Noel isn't even linked fyi

Shu:
Hmm

Shu:
I think so

Cammerhammer:
It should be fine? Just run your HGs up to the front

nexusnuva:
I mean

Arcus:
it's not like you need your best handguns to clear the map

Shu:
But I doubt you‚Äôll get an S

nexusnuva:
Yeahhhh

nexusnuva:
That's the main concern

Cammerhammer:
You can withdraw a doll and her HP still counts towards the total

suguri:
the chump mobs are good enough for your midlevel dolls to cut their teeth oon

Cammerhammer:
You just need to know when to withdraw her

Shu:
You just need to kill her before she shields

nexusnuva:
I could probably walk away with Calico and welrod wanting an 8 hour sleep

Shu:
Or you‚Äôre fckd

Lilya Starikova:
derp

suguri:
you need to have over 70% hp remaining compared to the hp you started the battle with

Lilya Starikova:
Just use 3 AR 2HG

Lilya Starikova:
i mean

Lilya Starikova:
3 RF and 2 HG

Lilya Starikova:
my bad

nexusnuva:
Also

Lilya Starikova:
and chessed through elphet

Shu:
Yeah you‚Äôre gonna need a rifle squad if you want to get an S

nexusnuva:
I learnt the hard way to not use arsmg against elphelt

Shu:
Yeah

nexusnuva:
My lvl90+ team was just rekt

Cammerhammer:
Well, you can use ARSMG if you can boost their damage high enough

nexusnuva:
I walked away with like

Cammerhammer:
Or use 6P62

nexusnuva:
A d

nexusnuva:
Like my chinese

Shu:
I have a max ar squad and I can barely get S

Lilya Starikova:
MONKAS

Lilya Starikova:
6p62

Lilya Starikova:
that reminds me

Lilya Starikova:
i have to level her

Cammerhammer:
You don't have to

nexusnuva:
Wait

Cammerhammer:
She's... not great

Cammerhammer:
I like her though

Cammerhammer:
So

Cammerhammer:
Yanno

Lilya Starikova:
im still leveling 6p62

Lilya Starikova:
cuz why not

nexusnuva:
If I were to go 3rf 2hg who should I swap out

Cammerhammer:
She a qt

Cammerhammer:
I have her sailor skin

suguri:
she's the producer's daughter

Shu:
I don‚Äôt think you need 3 rf

nexusnuva:
(X) doubt

Lilya Starikova:
i did a 3 RF

Lilya Starikova:
it's hillarious

nexusnuva:
<:RibDiedInside:414195386199179265>

Cammerhammer:
Do 5RF

Shu:
Oof

nexusnuva:
Was it fast?

Shu:
I need to make a bamboo squad tbh

Shu:
I don‚Äôt have one yet

Cammerhammer:
Bamboo isn't necessary atm

nexusnuva:
Lol?

Shu:
It‚Äôs better to start one now than regret it later

nexusnuva:
Bamboos can ohko bosses

nexusnuva:
And skip 2nd phase

Cammerhammer:
I recommend working on getting a solid three echelons first before going for bamboo

suguri:
you don't need bamboos that do 28k damage to kill something with 12k max hp

nexusnuva:
Even if they aren't nessecary now you need them pretty soon

Shu:
That‚Äôs why I said later

nexusnuva:
U can use them against elphelt anyway

Cammerhammer:
Ehhh

suguri:
you're spending 15 seconds doing something that you can do in 6

suguri:
the only weird ones I suppose are the >800 ars

suguri:
they just have the same disassemble value as ar set 2

suguri:
but just as an example

suguri:
smgs need 400/400/30/30

suguri:
so they disassemble for 5/5/2/0

Vinen:
<:g36Lazy:481469060589027329>

Vinen:
Bar is full of Chads

nexusnuva:
<:RibDiedInside:414195386199179265> I'm starting to hate the fact that I need to switch welrod and Calico's places

Vinen:
Time to raid the mini fridge and farm 02

nexusnuva:
My phone screen is stupidly faulty too

nexusnuva:
One swipe

skaianDestiny:
man i want our t-dolls to run around in mechs

nexusnuva:
Nothing

nexusnuva:
2nd swipe

nexusnuva:
Nothing

nexusnuva:
3rd swipe

nexusnuva:
Calico retreats to the back

nexusnuva:
Bringing forward **M14**

nexusnuva:
The fuck is this jank

commie:
OOF

commie:
at least if you were using an RoF echelon you could just slap a stechkin at the back and proper tanking HGs at the front

McSparky:
T-dolls in mechs? IDW gets Liger Zero

Kyle:
whatre good tank handguns besides makarov and welrod?

nexusnuva:
Also how do I put an ech like this in X formation?

voler_1:
cz75

Kyle:
she can tank?

voler_1:
no

Shu:
Nice squad

voler_1:
she cant do anything i think

Kyle:
üò≠

voler_1:
she just has a cool abilty

nexusnuva:
Isn't calico gonna get the shaft from stupid genoverse

nexusnuva:
Ok maybe not genoverse

voler_1:
just move them into an x formation

voler_1:
and you can flex on elphelt

nexusnuva:
But Calico is gonna get shredded

Shu:
No

nexusnuva:
She can't tank right?

voler_1:
i maen

nexusnuva:
She can?

voler_1:
all pistols can tank a little

nexusnuva:
<:rhekaqualicious:427804806892224532> I've been lied to

Cammerhammer:
Ehhhh

Cammerhammer:
Calico's evasion is rubbish

nexusnuva:
Yeah

nexusnuva:
Thought so

Shu:
I have that same formation

voler_1:
i need welrod reeeee

Shu:
What I do I move welrod and calico to the front when the fight starts

Cammerhammer:
Makarov is basically budget Welrod

voler_1:
also i dont like how welrod looks

Shu:
I know it sounds retarded but it works

nexusnuva:
I don't like how calico looks

Shu:
That‚Äôs why there‚Äôs costumes

nexusnuva:
Also why would I want to move them to the front?

voler_1:
ye

voler_1:
i like her halloween skin and the twilight skin

Shu:


Shu:
Idk

nexusnuva:
I got no skin

Shu:
It just works

nexusnuva:
Wait

nexusnuva:
By front you mean

nexusnuva:
Front row

Shu:
Yes

Cammerhammer:
What I do is I shuffle Welrod to 6, Calico to 2 then I drop Welrod back to 5

Shu:
When the match starts

nexusnuva:
But

nexusnuva:
Why <:minkFAL:410657215486230528>

Shu:
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

nexusnuva:
What does that even accomplish

Shu:
Idk

nexusnuva:
Seems like <:ShotMink:410655372840402945>

Cammerhammer:
I recommend reading some guides on kiting

Shu:
Yeah

Shu:
I do that too

Cammerhammer:
It's extremely useful for extending the fighting life of your echelon

nexusnuva:
Oh you mean kiting them by moving them to the front initially

Cammerhammer:
Ye

nexusnuva:
Then moving them back?

Shu:
That‚Äôs not what I meant but I do that to lol

nexusnuva:
<:NOPE:500694246429556757>

nexusnuva:
Confuse

nexusnuva:
I very confuse

Shu:
Tbh you just need a stronger team

nexusnuva:
Does it not work if you don't?

Shu:
It be like that tho

Shu:
No

nexusnuva:
<:suomiNANI:414084644322017280>

nexusnuva:
What

Shu:
Ikr

Cammerhammer:
On the Elphelt fight your rifles aren't far enough forward to shoot her initially

Shu:
I was like wtf

Cammerhammer:
You need to extend your range by moving your handguns to the front row

nexusnuva:
Wait

nexusnuva:
WAIT

Cammerhammer:
Your firing line changes depending on how far forward your frontmost guns are

nexusnuva:
Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat

Shu:
Maybe that‚Äôs it

nexusnuva:
I didn't even know

Cammerhammer:
That's sad

Kzar:
yeah no

ASCEE:
there was a time

ASCEE:
I actually got my quick repair to 0

Vinen:
How

Cammerhammer:
Event?

Rose ‚ôß:
thonk

Siege Waifus:
Impossible

ASCEE:
corpse dragging

Cammerhammer:
What

Siege Waifus:
I was pretty sue the game would just give you like 500 if you had only one left

Rose ‚ôß:
my lowest quick repair count was 50

Rose ‚ôß:
and that was 5 months ago

ASCEE:
that was pretty long ago tho

LoneWalker:
How many hours did you put in this game to get to 0

ASCEE:
right now I have 2k+

Cammerhammer:
GFL really hates making you wait for things

Rose ‚ôß:
"forced labor contract"

ASCEE:
I was dragging the whole day

ASCEE:
for a couple of weeks

LoneWalker:
I think thats prob one of the things I like most about GFL is that it isnt a wallet killer like 99% of mobile games

Siege Waifus:
By the time I even found out about quick repairs, I was already over 100

Cammerhammer:
Ironically, the way they make things easy for you to progress without money makes me more likely to buy things

Rose ‚ôß:
I whaled for dorms and echelon slots

ASCEE:
like furniture

ASCEE:
and daily packages

ASCEE:
to make things more easier

skaianDestiny:
you have to actively get rid of quick repairs and if you falter for even a moment you're back up to where you were at

nexusnuva:
What should I put in that last slot

skaianDestiny:
like literally showers you with quick repairs

Cammerhammer:
Contender

LoneWalker:
This is the only mobile game I have actually spent money on

nguuuquaaa:
5-7 or Stechkin

LoneWalker:
and i still didnt get the lee enfield wedding dress

LoneWalker:
sad

nexusnuva:
No contender omegalul

Cammerhammer:
RIP

Siege Waifus:
Same, though it took too much effort for me to actually be able yo spend my money on it

Siege Waifus:
You really can't have euros on your account

Siege Waifus:
Or anything other than dollars

ASCEE:
I actually use PHP

ASCEE:
for this

suguri:
if you use paypal you can use any currency

Siege Waifus:
Or credit card

Siege Waifus:
You just can't buy prepaid cards if they're not in dollars

Siege Waifus:
Fucking google

LoneWalker:
just use your credit card until you are in debt

Siege Waifus:
Mine's a debit card, so it's impossible

James1328:
Google Gift Card

art12345:
so why does dismantling give you back such a pitiful amount of actual supplies

art12345:
lets just say it takes like uhhh

art12345:
400+ of each resource, and you get a 2 or 3 star

art12345:
and all for the 3 star, is only 2 of each other supply

art12345:
not even that

Draconex:
C O R E S

art12345:
it doesn't even include parts

art12345:
sure, cores

Draconex:
B E C A U S E. C O R E S

Draconex:
Reeeeeeeeeee

Draconex:
<:M4A1depression:410654965892382721>

c3:
that's a hg and how much rsc you get depends on the type of doll

art12345:
still

art12345:
does it vary by that much

art12345:
between each one

art12345:
i doubt it breaks past 100

art12345:
for a singular unit

c3:
if you grind a lot, the rsc you get out of scrapping fodder still adds up, if they buffed that, it would disincentivise other means of getting rsc

commie:
don't rage craft

commie:
we're getting shit in december

Pacbough:
yeah dismantling dolls isnt the main source of rsc

c3:
a mg nets you 5-5-5

art12345:
oh boy 5

suguri:
sure it is

suguri:
you run 1-2 with the hgs it drops

suguri:
then dismantle them after they run out of their stock ammo and rations

commie:
MGs give parts

suguri:
literally GAINING resources with each clear

suguri:
mgs and sgs give parts

commie:
dismantling SGs is eh

suguri:
anything that costs more than 30 parts gives parts from dismantling

commie:
but MGs drop often enough in clears

commie:
20 2* MGs you wouldn't think about twice are 100 parts

commie:
what, from disassembling?

suguri:
normal resources are based on their minimum recipe

c3:
anyway, the game is incredibly f2p friendly as it is, don't forget that they still have to make money and getting people to buy rsc is one way to that

art12345:
ohh

art12345:
minimun recipe

art12345:
tru tru

commie:
imagine the inflation of resources if they gave more than a tiny amount of resources

Siege Waifus:
~~idw~~

Pacbough:
enough to fill 10 echelons

LoneWalker:
Cause my dad would be very disappointed <:SOPMODfunnyfeic:427804752701554719>

James1328:
>Sending an oathed doll to logistics

James1328:
<:RibBleeding:415391866822066176>

Siege Waifus:
Lul

Pacbough:
<:mk48LUL:500681251733110785>

Pacbough:
once my echelons reach lvl 100 and max skills they become logistics mules

LoneWalker:
Is that a form of ntr <:thonk9:410657576892497930>

James1328:
~~Yes~~

Siege Waifus:
I've been leveling up my forgotten dolls now, nothing like the satisfaction of seeing SIG-510 and M38 joining the x4 linked ranks while Grizzly and WA2000 have to wait

James1328:
What?

James1328:
Up to what level are you leveling them?

Pacbough:
<:g11spit:410657877825683456>

Siege Waifus:
70 for now

James1328:
Oof

James1328:
Not 90

James1328:
You are doing an Aku

Siege Waifus:
They're all ~level 30

Siege Waifus:
When I have everyone level 70 at least, then it's up to level 90

James1328:
It is more practical to level them to 90 and x5 them

Siege Waifus:
Eh

Siege Waifus:
It's the same

ASCEE:
<:springTea:427818533431410691> I level them all to 100

Siege Waifus:
Right now I have a lot of level 70 ones, of I were leveling them all up to 90 I would have less of them on level 90

James1328:
The real waste of time

James1328:
Is leveling 90 to 100

Siege Waifus:
Yup

Siege Waifus:
120k+ exp to level up

Vinen:
<@363134330710786048> <:NO:427807134240079883>

James1328:
I mean

James1328:
It is very time inefficent

James1328:
Better level another doll from 1 to 90

Siege Waifus:
That's why I leveling them all up to 70, then 90, then 100

ASCEE:
I have dolls that leveled from lvl 1-80 just from auto battles

Siege Waifus:
That's nice, once I get the rest of the echelons will probably be the same

ASCEE:
always have them run 1-1n

ASCEE:
for passive equipment upgrades

Siege Waifus:
I do the same but for 3-4n, for STAR's equipment, it's the next on the line for me

Kzar:
i had them run 2-4N for aunt bar's equipment

Kzar:
but had to stop after like 1 day <:RibDiedInside:414195386199179265>

Kyle:
lol as soon as i get a new doll i want to eventually level i just stick them in my auto battle team

Cammerhammer:
Guys, I have a problem

Kyle:
theyll get there

Kyle:
slowly...

Cammerhammer:
I can't stop hoarding rsc

Kyle:

Vinen:
I'm back up to 60

Vinen:
But in have all dolls but floof

Cammerhammer:
Sooner or later I'm going to break and start ragecrafting for IWS

Vinen:
Done that one

Vinen:
Was painful

Vinen:
Not as painful as attempting to ragecraft for KSG with my cc

Pacbough:
i rage crafted with CC during floof rateup

Pacbough:

Pacbough:
<:suomiNANI:414084644322017280>

Cammerhammer:
I don't craft with CC

Cammerhammer:
That's strictly for costumes

LoneWalker:
CC?

Cammerhammer:
credit card

üí≥

LoneWalker:
ooooo

oh no

suguri:
crafting with cc is a recipe for suffering

suguri:
each heavy costs $18

suguri:
<:GudaCano:427805886757601280>

LoneWalker:
Unless you a rich boy I cant see a good reason to craft with CC

Cammerhammer:
Seriously, just run logistics

Cammerhammer:
Then wait for rateup

Kzar:
>ragecraft with üí∏

LoneWalker:
maybe hes a rich boy

Kzar:
only jap üê≥ do that

ASCEE:
I don't CC with costume

Kzar:

C4Cypher:
Granted, 4-3E is a sweet little strip for grinding whites for enhancement

C4Cypher:
And supposedly it has a higher blue drop rate or something, but I don't know how seriously to take that

c3:
I'm at over 1k cores, make of that what you wish

C4Cypher:
Duly noted <:homete:410658578014273538>

almost 1200 cores

You must play til you become KR or CN player

James1328:
<:OK:500692128058572800>

C4Cypher:
It's kinda funny, I'm pretty convinced the devs were fully aware of the L85's reputation among the Brits, so they made her a klutz and a ditz with worthless buffs

Sparkee100:
MP5 says hi

c3:
I'll try <:RibDiedInside:414195386199179265>

commie:
play until you turn asian

C4Cypher:
What I don't understand is why they made AK47 worthless

c3:
okay, point taken <@!182627054892613632>

Chripper:
~~So basically start a new game on one of thse 2 servers.~~

c3:
with her special equip her dmg actually even turns decent, according to my data

skaianDestiny:
her buff tile sucks mainly

skaianDestiny:
mod 3 to fix that when

LoneWalker:
Isn't rule one of gfl: is not to like any Raifu because the ones you like most likely suck

skaianDestiny:
hell mod 3 to make her AR tank for shiggles

Pacbough:
no, rule 1 is to force your raifu to be viable in every situation

C4Cypher:
But <@!184457066805592065> the Raifu I like is Homete ... and she *scares* the other dolls I have with how quickly she melts faces

Pacbough:
<:SOPMODfunnyfeic:427804752701554719>

LoneWalker:
I have a ton of extra 5 stars but I'm way too lazy to level up the dolls to dummy link

Siege Waifus:
Can't say which one is my raifu, they're all good dolls

If you can have them all*

commie:
we apologize for our lack of language skills :V

Vinen:
I spent 30K or so USD on FFBE last year

Mo.Sin:
no

Mo.Sin:
i'm confused

Mo.Sin:
when i said it isnt

Mo.Sin:
lol

Mo.Sin:
wasnt making fun of

McSparky:
He's also the only shikikan kalina would sleep with love

commie:
30k dorrar ü§î

Mo.Sin:
30k with whose money

Vinen:
mine

commie:
I wonder how it's like to live in a country that isn't a shithole :V

[Smol](Whale God)Operative Wolf:


commie:
where are my EU moneys for mobage

[Smol](Whale God)Operative Wolf:
^i used to have a mil

commie:
this should be covered under development funds

[Smol](Whale God)Operative Wolf:
To make a Girls frontline RTS mod for a very old EA game

Kyle:
yeah she's just solid and cheap

Mo.Sin:
i got like 3 more fnc

Kyle:
making her a good option

Siege Waifus:
links aren't a problem for me

[Smol](Whale God)Operative Wolf:
I both regret and love my choice

Kyle:
i still would not use famas though

Vinen:
what choice

Mo.Sin:
I have 100 cores

Kyle:
theres a dozen + better ARs

Siege Waifus:
considering I get so many FAMAS when trying to pull G41

Mo.Sin:
so im looking pretty alright

[Smol](Whale God)Operative Wolf:
Learning 3D modeling

Vinen:
ohh

Vinen:
Are you making lewd models

Vinen:
<:hkLewded:484732421485494272>

Mo.Sin:
but i havent been playing this game

[Smol](Whale God)Operative Wolf:
To replicate all GFL dolls models

Mo.Sin:
Ive been playing other gachas

[Smol](Whale God)Operative Wolf:
To replace the infantry units

Mo.Sin:
tbh

[Smol](Whale God)Operative Wolf:
<@!284468918456811520> pls if I do that I‚Äôll get blocked from modb.com

Mo.Sin:


Mo.Sin:
these are all my 5* nd 4*

commie:
famas and 56 are cores if you don't have any particular reason to have them

Marv Singer:
G36?

c3:
^ the rest is very good

[Smol](Whale God)Operative Wolf:
I link them first then core the spares

Mo.Sin:
what about g36

[Smol](Whale God)Operative Wolf:
Keep her

c3:
she's okay

[Smol](Whale God)Operative Wolf:
She‚Äôs getting a mod iii

commie:
g36 is like a tier 4 FNC

Marv Singer:
was debating on replacing famas with g36, tar 21 or ribeyrolles

commie:
if the FNC is a very good tier 3, G36 is a very good tier 4

Mo.Sin:
yeah i was thinking of using ump45

Mo.Sin:
but she's lvl 1 rn

Mo.Sin:
and idk if i have cores to uphold that

c3:
she's arguably the best main tank

Mo.Sin:
ye if you have a nice team you can reccomend

Mo.Sin:
from what you can see

Mo.Sin:
what i have

Mo.Sin:
i can try leveling

Marv Singer:
this is my best team xD

Mo.Sin:
5 5* you must be stacked

c3:
45 is basically a 4* ingram and as moon said, g36 is a 4* fnc, so they're straight upgrades to each other

LoneWalker:
Whoa pal it's illegal to "xD"

Marv Singer:
fine cD

Mo.Sin:
anyplace to put tar?

commie:
wew almost no synergy

c3:
in your second team

Vinen:
Having Seweromi in your "best" team

Vinen:
also MG in that team

Vinen:
WHAT

LoneWalker:
Well you got me

Vinen:
Pretty sure you can make a better eam with 3 and 4*s

Vinen:
tile buffs are OP

c3:
if you can manage to raise those slowly, you'll be set for the rest of the game

commie:
you can, he's just flexing 5*s and oaths

commie:
I hope

commie:
I seriously hope so

Mo.Sin:
you mean the one i have?

Vinen:
thats a flex?

c3:
aye

Mo.Sin:
ones i have in my current team

Mo.Sin:
or the upgrades

commie:
what is that but not an attempt at flexing?

Vinen:
pretty flaccid flex

Vinen:
not even level 100

commie:
a flex nonetheless

Marv Singer:
xD

Vinen:
muscles are dragging on the ground like my RL ones

Vinen:
<:SOPwao:465878170046955521>

Vinen:
"muscles"

Vinen:
I mean fat

c3:
honestly either way would be fine, but if you have the cores as you say I see no reason not to go for their upgrades right now, since you're still low leveled

Mo.Sin:
i could

Marv Singer:
if it is really that much of problem that i just posted my team then nvm

Vinen:
argggg running ADV until my Elph hits 90

Vinen:
I'm just being a douche

LoneWalker:
I like your team cause you got Lee Enfield

LoneWalker:
I'm just allergic to "xD"

c3:
<@151849252086218753> your team is just a classic example of beginner mistakes

Vinen:
^

Vinen:
I did stuff like that too

Vinen:
like

Vinen:
using Kar

Vinen:
<:RibDiedInside:414195386199179265> üî´ <:RibBleeding:415391866822066176>

commie:
oathing 5 dolls? ye

commie:
my kar is at 2x

commie:
I have big ragrets

Vinen:
I have a 5x 100 Kar now

Vinen:
to cover the shame

Vinen:
I leveled her for

Vinen:
logisitics

commie:
yes

commie:
ofc you did

Siege Waifus:
lol

Siege Waifus:
she was actually my 5 star Rf

Vinen:
she was my first 5*

Kyle:
desert vulture

commie:
vulture's kind of bad

Siege Waifus:
You can use the Desert Eagle name

Kid:
desert talon bird

commie:
a falcon is a bird of prey, kind of shares a theme with the eagle

Kyle:
you shut your mouth, vultures are precious

Kyle:
precious ugly rotten meat eaters

commie:
ur a vulture

commie:
take that

Siege Waifus:
Call of Duty had it, Battlefield as well

Kyle:
im highly endangered?

Kid:
AKSHUALLY

Kid:
vultures don't eat

Kyle:
old world or new world vulture?

Kid:
rotten meat

commie:
those are big IPs though

Kid:
they only eat fresh dead stuff

commie:
they can more than easily afford any needed licensing fees

Siege Waifus:
unless they started to get angry more recently idk

[Smol](Whale God)Operative Wolf:
I hope mica goes a tad futuristic with some next gen guns

[Smol](Whale God)Operative Wolf:
Cause

Kyle:
they can eat rotten meat and do on occasion

[Smol](Whale God)Operative Wolf:
We

Kyle:
depends on what type

[Smol](Whale God)Operative Wolf:
Are making them

Kid:
well yeah

Kid:
you can eat rotten meat too if it comes down to it

[Smol](Whale God)Operative Wolf:
The dam lazer rifle from China

Kid:
lel

Kyle:
no i wouldnt

Mo.Sin:


Kyle:
because thats suicide

Mo.Sin:
how good?

Kid:
not good

c3:
3 cores

[Smol](Whale God)Operative Wolf:
That‚Äôs def a CN exclusive

Kyle:
a painful suicide

commie:
1 baguette out of ü•ñ

Mo.Sin:
oh

Mo.Sin:
feelsadman

commie:
don't

Mo.Sin:
how about tokarev

commie:
vive la france

c3:
1 core

Kyle:
im no vulture, im not immune to botulism, cholera, or anthrax

Mo.Sin:
oh

Kyle:
i have squishy human parts

Mo.Sin:
ri0

Mo.Sin:
girls frontline is the only gacha thats live rn

c3:
those 2 are some of the worst in their respective class. better luck next time

Mo.Sin:
feelsad

commie:
there's that one about boats

Siege Waifus:
Use them both, they're not meta but they're decent enough

commie:
it's also alive? I think?

Kid:
i don't think vultures are fucking invincible but ok

Mo.Sin:
Nah I got alright units

Marv Singer:
so famas is a terrible 4 star?

Kyle:
they arent

[Smol](Whale God)Operative Wolf:
Wait

c3:
she is

Kyle:
if they were they wouldnt be so endangered

commie:
well marv let's put it this way

[Smol](Whale God)Operative Wolf:
AWM

[Smol](Whale God)Operative Wolf:
AWP

commie:
she's worse than most of the other options

Siege Waifus:
then they're both for logistics or nothing

commie:
but if she is your raifu

[Smol](Whale God)Operative Wolf:
That iconic heavy SR from CS

c3:
famas is a nader with horrible low base dmg, making her useless in the one job she had

commie:
then you can treasure her and level her to 100

Mo.Sin:


Cammerhammer:
Her skill is referred to as a "celebratory firecracker"

Mo.Sin:
This my waifu

commie:
and then never take her out of logistics

Kyle:
just retire her

Marv Singer:
famas isnt my waifu was wondering what you recommend then since i got like 6 famas

commie:
<@194653592160829441> üöî <:shortycuffs:415012355596877824>

commie:
18 cores, nice

Mo.Sin:
shutup

Mo.Sin:
:GWskarzzMonkaGun:

Mo.Sin:
<:RodTime:484729471728091147>

Marv Singer:
Lee Enfield is my waifu xD

Siege Waifus:
The skill is also not as good as the other grenadier skill

c3:
if you need a ar for starters, just stick with fnc. she can carry you until end game on her own

Mo.Sin:
yeah my team.rn is

Mo.Sin:
uh

Mo.Sin:


c3:
that's pretty damn good

Kyle:
i burned my 5 famas' and got g11 right after

c3:
just level them more

Siege Waifus:
I never got why FNC is considered so good. She has stats that aren't as good as Famas (at least when I had them both at the same level)

Kyle:
so i recommend that

Kyle:
well fnc is 3* and famas is 4*

[Smol](Whale God)Operative Wolf:
Currently studying modeling and animation

Marv Singer:
should i replace famas with Ribeyrolles or one of the AR team

Mo.Sin:
shes the best 3*

Kyle:
so a lot cheaper to link

Vinen:
<:fncFat:502098769379196928>

c3:
fnc's base stats are already okay and her self dmg buff is pretty decent

Mo.Sin:
and theres plentiful link copies

commie:
we can make a collective effort and draw a loli gun robot together on ms paint

commie:
it can't be that hard, can it?

[Smol](Whale God)Operative Wolf:
Name American one gun that mica hasn‚Äôt added

Elphelt Valentine:
5-7 as a special drop
will never become a normal drop or a normal construct doll.

commie:
trap door springfield :V

[Smol](Whale God)Operative Wolf:
That‚Äôs British

[Smol](Whale God)Operative Wolf:
Wait

[Smol](Whale God)Operative Wolf:
Springfield?

[Smol](Whale God)Operative Wolf:
She‚Äôs already in it

[Smol](Whale God)Operative Wolf:
Omg the auto fuck

The Laughing Man:
I don't even know what are American guns in this game

[Smol](Whale God)Operative Wolf:
I‚Äôm done

Elphelt Valentine:
L1A1 SLR

commie:
trapdoor springfield is british?

SleepyDuck:
Springfield is a trap?

[Smol](Whale God)Operative Wolf:
M4a1

SleepyDuck:
Wat

[Smol](Whale God)Operative Wolf:
Ar 15

[Smol](Whale God)Operative Wolf:
M1919

[Smol](Whale God)Operative Wolf:
Bar

commie:
if you only list american guns that are already in the game, you won't find american guns that aren't in the game

[Smol](Whale God)Operative Wolf:
Mica kinda covered the iconic USA guns

commie:
ü§î

The Laughing Man:
How about a Canadian gun <:SOPwao:465878170046955521>

commie:
ross rifle leave

Elphelt Valentine:
Tac-50

commie:
cease this immediate moment

Elphelt Valentine:
wait.

Siege Waifus:
Trapdoor Springfield =/= Springfield M1903

[Smol](Whale God)Operative Wolf:
That‚Äôs already out in the int servers

[Smol](Whale God)Operative Wolf:
I mean

[Smol](Whale God)Operative Wolf:
There‚Äôs the minigun

[Smol](Whale God)Operative Wolf:
Highly unlikely mica is gonna add it

Elphelt Valentine:
Mk18

commie:
why does it have to be american anyway?

commie:
and even if it has to be american, browning 1917, or are t dolls to weak to carry water?

Whole Wheat cum:
"There is nothing wrong with perverted girls".             -Mahatma Gandhi

commie:
I think this is bait

commie:
the handle and profile pic seem kind of fishy

Whole Wheat cum:
The handle?

Whole Wheat cum:
You man handling people?!

Siege Waifus:
I just x4 linked MG42

Chripper:
What about a DP12?

Chripper:
aka the shotgun version of g11.

Elphelt Valentine:
AHA

Elphelt Valentine:
confirmed in GFL

Elphelt Valentine:

<:suomiNANI:414084644322017280>

[Smol](Whale God)Operative Wolf:
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_assault_rifles

[Smol](Whale God)Operative Wolf:
^good list

Whole Wheat cum:
They need to add the street sweeper

commie:
looks like a very american website

[Smol](Whale God)Operative Wolf:
Wrong list

Whole Wheat cum:
Wait a fucking minute

Whole Wheat cum:
They forget burst

[Smol](Whale God)Operative Wolf:
Airburst?

Whole Wheat cum:
Burst mode

commie:
airburst? we're talking artillery now?

Siege Waifus:
XM25 raifu when?

[Smol](Whale God)Operative Wolf:
The anti infantry grenade launcher?

Whole Wheat cum:
No ya daft cunt

Whole Wheat cum:
Burst as in a burst of a limited number of bullets

commie:
yes, I think we are aware of that

commie:
what is your point though?

Whole Wheat cum:
That link saids semi/fully automatic but forgot to mention burst

commie:


commie:
a little bit of effort, come on

Pacbough:
That's not a requirement to be an assault rifle though

[Smol](Whale God)Operative Wolf:
Mica could keep an eye on the LSAT rifle or the LR300

[Smol](Whale God)Operative Wolf:
Or the RAX

commie:
or

commie:
non-american iconic weapons

[Smol](Whale God)Operative Wolf:
Or future American weapons

[Smol](Whale God)Operative Wolf:
Either way works

[Smol](Whale God)Operative Wolf:
I‚Äôm looking for Canada rn

commie:
vickers mmg when

Siege Waifus:
MG08/15 when

commie:
sterling wouldn't be a bad choice either, it's a design most people will recognize

Siege Waifus:
yeah

commie:
from SW, that is

[Smol](Whale God)Operative Wolf:
I wonder if mica takes musket era weapons

Siege Waifus:
probably not

commie:
tanegashima when 8)

c3:
let's not get silly

skaianDestiny:
desert eagle for EN exclusive weapon when

Siege Waifus:
civil war era or after

Siege Waifus:
the LeMat revolvers would be nice

[Smol](Whale God)Operative Wolf:
Isn‚Äôt the DE Israeli?

commie:
mas 36 for more baguette

c3:
it is

Kid:
apples and destruction

[Smol](Whale God)Operative Wolf:
Wouldn‚Äôt mica need permission from the manufacturers first?

Siege Waifus:
Martini-Henry, Spencer Rifle

Siege Waifus:
no

Kid:
yes

Siege Waifus:
why do you think we have FF FNP9, FNC, etc

Siege Waifus:
Gr G41, MP5, etc

[Smol](Whale God)Operative Wolf:
I know there was an issue from some games using guns without permission

commie:
just call it desert falcon :V

[Smol](Whale God)Operative Wolf:
A while back

Pungey:
The dolls drawn by sumois artist are called pigs

c3:
just when a boss was released that made it seem like suomi would have a use, they also released mp7 along with it, rendering her obsolete. hence there a comic about it in which mp7 calls her that

Pungey:
Sumoi, RFB, K2

Chripper:
<:RibDiedInside:414195386199179265> oh

Chripper:
Isnt MP7 a limited/special drop?

Pungey:
~~You wish~~

nguuuquaaa:
MP7 is map clear iirc

Chripper:
Oh. <:thonk9:410657576892497930>

Pungey:
<:thonk9:410657576892497930>

commie:
she's a drop according to the wiki

c3:
you can't craft her in any case

nguuuquaaa:
oh right, drop

Chripper:
<:thonk9:410657576892497930>

commie:
so yeah, get ready for farm her :V

Pungey:
<:ShotMink:410655372840402945>

nguuuquaaa:
shit hoxy incoming <:SOPMODfunnyfeic:427804752701554719>

Chripper:
So she can't be crafted, but can be obtained through drop/map clear.

Chripper:
<:thonk9:410657576892497930> Alright.

c3:
affirmative

commie:
well, calling it map clear isn't exactly accurate

Pungey:
Still a drop for S ranking the map

Vinen:
what event is MP7 part of?

commie:
since it's an event, you'd probably want to call "map clears" those dolls that are guaranteed drops from clearing the map

nguuuquaaa:
Singularity

Vinen:
o

Pungey:
Map clear is something like groza

commie:
like elphelt for clearing her 6 times

Chripper:
Oh, I see.

commie:
in any case don't worry

Chripper:
Seems like it's a long time.

Chripper:
<:thonk9:410657576892497930>

commie:
you'll have reasons to quit soon enough when they release the 5-7 event :V

Chripper:
~~Let me get my 2nd 5-7~~

Chripper:
<:rhekaqualicious:427804806892224532>

commie:
why not? isn't she good enough? :V

commie:
but fine we can go with other examples

commie:
oldfeg

Chripper:
~~Trolling purposes~~

commie:
you can quit years from now when we finally get singularity and you fail to drop an mp7

commie:
this is my curse for you

commie:
if I had a goat I'd sacrifice it right now

commie:
but alas, I live in a city

Chripper:
<:hkStare:414084643994992640>

Chripper:
<:hkStare2:414084643848192006>

Chripper:
Ok

Siege Waifus:
imagine starting to play the game after the Super SASS event and then the devs release the veteran callback with her and you have played everyday since you first started ~~like me~~

commie:
me too thanks

commie:
but eh like I say sometimes, we'll have the chance for them later on

Chripper:
Another Sass dupe. <:thonk9:410657576892497930>

commie:
this event is the true point of no return

Siege Waifus:
yeah, I'm not that mad about it

Siege Waifus:
but it's still a kick in the nuts

commie:
not sure about axe waifu but it's not unlikely that we get an event with her again

commie:
at least I hope so, but no reason to make her that limited

commie:
remember that above all

Siege Waifus:
NOOOOOO

commie:
pls enjoy game

commie:
well you didn't take my advice very seriously

Siege Waifus:
oh wait

Siege Waifus:
I misread that

Siege Waifus:
you mean, we will have another CZ75 event again?

commie:
don't quote me on it

Siege Waifus:
I fucking hope so

Chripper:
It seems likely.

Siege Waifus:
I started playing the game mid event

commie:
but what I'm saying is that there is no point in making CZ a limited drop for the beginning of the EN server

Siege Waifus:
mid-late actually

Chripper:
~~Just not for a long time~~

commie:
event dolls like operation rabbit hunt? that I can understand

commie:
but hey I'm not management

commie:
for all we know, they might just go "lol late guys, no cz 4 u"

Siege Waifus:
I literally ended the event with 1500~1600 points

Chripper:
<:hkStare2:414084643848192006>

Chripper:
Oohh, that salt.

Siege Waifus:
started playing it 9 days before the end

commie:
thanks, when that event ended I didn't have an account and was hella busy on a summer job

LoneWalker:
Is EN gonna have the chance to get 57 again <:SOPMODfunnyfeic:427804752701554719>

Vinen:
yes

Vinen:
far down the rd

Siege Waifus:
and couldn't do anything else, since it was either get 5* dolls without many resources and contracts, get more likes on my dorms, or calibrations, when I didn't even get equipment manufacture unlocked yet

Chripper:
Next year.

Vinen:
from a rare drop

Vinen:
You won't get her for free like those of us did in June

M4 SOPMOD II MOD III:
Clearing singularity takes a lot of powah

commie:
hm, wasn't there an event before singularity that had five seven as a drop?

M4 SOPMOD II MOD III:
uhh

commie:
or was it singularity all along and I'm mixing stuff up?

[Smol](Whale God)Operative Wolf:
After the first singularity

M4 SOPMOD II MOD III:
I'm pretty sure DD drops 57

[Smol](Whale God)Operative Wolf:
Huh Ima pair Noel with fn57

[Smol](Whale God)Operative Wolf:
Along with elphet and floof

[Smol](Whale God)Operative Wolf:
Added with Wa2k

[Smol](Whale God)Operative Wolf:
Gonna get dat rof

commie:
hm, is mica unlikely to use five seven as a reward doll for a side event later on?

[Smol](Whale God)Operative Wolf:
I heard it rolls either cause we are getting events with free dolls of our choosing

[Smol](Whale God)Operative Wolf:
-one

The Laughing Man:
I think 5-7 will only appear as a drop from now on

commie:
exclusive EN dolls when anyway

[Smol](Whale God)Operative Wolf:
Um

The Laughing Man:
"I can't discuss this"

C4Cypher:
So is PP90 a main tank or an off tank?

c3:
her skill obviously recommends her for mt, but she's actually neither

c3:
:cores:

Chiaki:
her tiles suggest main (aka position 5) but she doesn't perform well

Chiaki:
her skill is super weak despite the duration

c3:
being a 4* idw doesn't make her stop being a idw

Chiaki:
~~idw is lowkey better than her in some situations~~

c3:

Vinen:
least I get Noel tomorrow

Vinen:
think I'm not farming anymore

Vinen:
too much work

Siege Waifus:
FMG-9 is a better PP90

Vinen:
thats not saying much

c3:
actually, a limited doll being better than anything *does* say a lot

c3:
considering how altogether junky they usually are

Yue:
Only farming Seithr for quick training contracts

Yue:
<:SOPMODfunnyfeic:427804752701554719>

Yue:
40 minutes of depression a day

Vinen:
PP90 is garbage like Seweromi

Vinen:
thou

C4Cypher:
Thanks. Didn't feel like feeding cores to another 5* anyway

Chripper:
<:umpOwO:500681384226979840>

Chripper:
~~All this SMG bashing~~

C4Cypher:
Not bashing I just don't need her

Chripper:
<:thonk9:410657576892497930> ok

Kyle:
did someone just call suomi seweromi

Kyle:
<:RodTime:484729471728091147>

Chripper:
So Suomi or IDW?

Siege Waifus:
lol

Chripper:
<:rhekaqualicious:427804806892224532>

Pungey:
Who called sumoi sewermoi?

Siege Waifus:
IDW is cheaper

skaianDestiny:


Chripper:
<:g11spit:410657877825683456>

Chripper:
~~IDW it is then?~~

DannyTheHero:
<:roCry:414084703323160576>

skaianDestiny:
dont bulli idw

skaianDestiny:
pls

Vinen:
always bulli IDW

C4Cypher:
Evo 3 looks like an off tank. I don't have a burning need for more but she'd be cheap to raise

commie:
idw danya

Vinen:
always turn her into RSC

it's just

commie:
20% eva to ARs

Chripper:
If smg takes heavy hit, switch spots with an Ar?

skaianDestiny:
maybe theyll introduce an enemy who shoots only the backline

Chripper:
That's kinda how I do it before...

Siege Waifus:
M16 buff?

commie:
eh, right now to deal with the mortar guys you either put a doll on the front row or DPS fast enough to clear the enemies before it gets more than 1 shot off

commie:
IDW isn't good for either

c3:
nah, to-be-introduced to en enemies shoot through the entire lines

Chripper:
Just bring the smg to backline and have the ARs tank if smg suffers heavy dmg.

I'm just saying where AR evasion buffs is possibly workable

~~tbf, I personally hate everything about IDW~~

Chripper:
Self Eva buffs are garbage? <:thonk9:410657576892497930>

c3:
pretty much

Y.Zhang:
She has a decently high Eva, so can be used for a two star echelon over her counterparts.

Pungey:
Not suomi's

c3:
elder pig is a special case

Chripper:
Elder pig?

c3:
aye

nguuuquaaa:
I'm not sure why self eva buff is garbage when there are snipers like Ouro and Dreamer

Pungey:
3 little pigs

Pungey:
Sumoi built her house out of straw

Siege Waifus:
FMG-9 self buff is like over 100%

Siege Waifus:
iirc

Y.Zhang:
As accuracy and evasion increase, the probability of hitting favours accuracy over time

Pungey:
FMG's effective HP is rubbish due to her low base hp

Siege Waifus:
yes, 120%

nguuuquaaa:
but there's literally nothing to tank snipers aside from self eva buff

Y.Zhang:
This is why defence fairies are nice

Pungey:
So no amount of eva can save her

Siege Waifus:
and her evasion stat is the highest of any smg

world population is 7.7 billion
the most accurate census has an error of +/- 0.5%

had to move m16 because of grizzly's buff, but overall she wouldn't have taken much more damage than this

commie:
the damage on the HGs is because I kept alt-tabbing out of habit

Siege Waifus:
I still hate that battle

commie:
oof accidentally tagged twice

suguri:
was this after 1 run or a full run

Siege Waifus:
it's basically get lucky or have your dolls overleveled, or nothing

commie:
full run?

commie:
you mean 5 battles?

suguri:
why did you get damage on those hgs

suguri:
yeah a complete 0-2

commie:


commie:
I was supposed to move M16 at the start

Chiaki:
<:thonk9:410657576892497930>

commie:
but yeah, 5 battles

commie:
I estimate you can get 3 runs per repair

Chiaki:
like

commie:
maxed crit scope and HV, plus maxed eva exo and armor plate

commie:
it's still hella cumbersome and I wouldn't want to do it

commie:
but theoretically you can drag with 3 buffers with 4x G11

suguri:
well there are buffers with more usable tile formations than this

commie:
I know, but those were my only 4x HGs

Chiaki:
if you're gonna move something every time why not just do this https://puu.sh/C9fHf/fde89d3c5d.jpg and move makarov

suguri:
you can just retreat maccas at the start

suguri:
every run

commie:
I'm kind of dumb pls no bulli

Chiaki:

Sparkee100:
What kind of squad is that ^^^

commie:


commie:
yeah it's actually pretty ok for dragging

commie:
this is max gear and skill level G11 though and I've achieved roughly the same damage on M16 with less buffers and skill level 8 FAL and soppo

commie:
so for what actually counts, it's not really efficient

commie:
even if just because you're grinding an extra doll

suguri:
if you aren't spamcrafting rfs and sgs manpower and parts aren't a huge deal

suguri:
and repair bills aren't even a huge problem to begin with

commie:
eh it's the time you invest on it

Vinen:
whats the best none 1 hour logistics to run for ammo?

suguri:
5-2

Vinen:
I don't have the autism levels to deal with the game hourly

suguri:
5-2 is a 2:30 log I think

suguri:
so it'll sync with 7-1

Chiaki:
that's correct

suguri:
<:OK:500692128058572800>

commie:
if you're grinding just for ammo do 7-2 tho

commie:
less time efficient but a chance for contracts

Chiaki:
now sugu, teach me the ways of reaching max rsc

Juliet Delta Tango 1-5:
~~LOGISTICS~~

suguri:
do 1-2 with the 4 hgs that drop from 1-2 and scrap them afterwards for your map clear and repairs daily

Chiaki:
but also spending a lot because equipment enhancement

Vinen:
im running 5-4

Vinen:
want to max parts

Vinen:
since I can whale other RSC if I want to be dumb

suguri:
it's hard to get manpower down specifically without zas dragging being a thing

commie:
eh but SGs are once a week and I need to detox from salt when pulling MGs

suguri:
unless I do 831 meme recipes for daily builds

commie:
what's the logic behind equip enhancements? does a certain type of fodder consume more of a resource?

suguri:
sgs take down rations which have no easy efficient logi that doesn't also give manpower

suguri:
the enhance cost is based on the equip recipe

Siege Waifus:
just keep doing 3-1 and 5-1

Siege Waifus:
first is 225/h and second is 200/h

suguri:
20 and 30 min log times

suguri:
<:RibBleeding:415391866822066176>

it's just nox with less bloat and running an older version of android

but c96 is garbage

she should stay pristine and cute

m14 with a rof self buff

commie:
has anyone dropped a 4* on the event stages, out of curiosity?

bluestacks is kind of cancerous

Best emulator

I sue Bluestacks as I'm lazy but it's kind of Eeeeeehhh

I have a phone

commie:
just spend 300 euros on a huawei p20 lite :V

I use nox and my phone

Chiaki:
including your phone

suguri:
rfs with gold scope and hoxy get above 100% crit even with px4balanced active

Bluestacks has had trouble registering my clicks lately

Siege Waifus:
I got SAA, and that's it, but quite a lot of 3* dolls though

Luxanna:
Genymotion ui works like shit, but when you launch gfl

Chiaki:
shut up i only did that once

James1328:
Today

Sunnie:
With nox, you can just download the nova launcher

Ajss123:
bluestacks didnt like zooming out when i had it

suguri:
whim still owns nep's innocence

suguri:
<:sealSmug:414085422277328896>

Ajss123:
nox with nova launcher is what i use now

Luxanna:
why would you download nova launcher

Luxanna:
?

Ajss123:
prevents popup stuff on nox

Luxanna:
lol

Luxanna:
what pop up stuff are you talking about

Luxanna:
<:thonk9:410657576892497930>

Chiaki:
ads

Sunnie:
there are a lot of benefits with using nox

Ajss123:
randomly adding app icons

Sunnie:
with nova launcher

Chiaki:
i use evie launcher but it's the same thing

Sunnie:
first is it eliminates the bloatware

Sunnie:
I swear nox uses your gpu to mine shit too

Sunnie:
no way does gfl use 40% of my gigabyte 1080

might as well rename my tablet to GFL, since it's 99% of it's use

suguri:
now that's what I call <:OK:500692128058572800> balance

Luxanna:
>balance in basically single player games

404% crit damage if it's a fury fairy instead

dolls with 9 in their name are related to flashbangs

I will just study during the weekend

Chiaki:
at this point it can't not be intentional

James1328:
M9?

Chiaki:
she doesn't drop in 0-2

Luxanna:
wait

Luxanna:

Milky Moo:
who doesn't drop

Chiaki:

Something something, I dropped Vector in 6.4E?

Milky Moo:
f2000?

Milky Moo:
she's a 2* rifle right?

Milky Moo:
i get her from prod all the time

Sunnie:
first 5 star drop I've ever heard of

commie:
2* AR, ye

Sunnie:
nice luck

Chiaki:
yeah, fishgun who's stronger than some 4*s in the game

commie:
she's on set 1, so over 800 total res can get her

Chiaki:
<:OK:500692128058572800>

An0n:
Did I win the lotery of dropping Vector >.>?

commie:

her thighs aren't thick enough for my tastes but she's cute enough

Siege Waifus:
self damage buffs

Sunnie:
you did win

art12345:
Stars are almlst meaninglrss in this game

Kyle:
i know they arent out yet, but are an94 and ak12 good?

Kyle:
bc they seem good

commie:
it's not that she's that good but when you say it like that, it's true because there are really bad 4*s

Chiaki:
they are pretty good

An0n:
F2000 is all right

art12345:
5 stars can be legit worse

art12345:
Than 2 stars

Chiaki:
that's all you need to know

Ajss123:
an94 and ak12 are pretty top tier

Kyle:
ayy

Kyle:
good to know

An0n:
I mean

Kyle:
bc theyre awesome

art12345:
Oops

An0n:
Though who best girl

An0n:
AK12 or AN94...

Luxanna:
ak-12 is creepy af

Kyle:
an94>ak12

Chiaki:
they're made to be disgustingly overpowered

Chiaki:
just accept

An0n:
AK12>AN94

Luxanna:
an-94 is bae

Luxanna:
owo

Kyle:
exactly

suguri:
f2k vs some 4*s <:OK:500692128058572800>

Milky Moo:
not great

Kyle:
scrap famas

Milky Moo:
only good for night

Milky Moo:
famas is garbage

Kyle:
for her lipstick

An0n:
VAL and 9A in day...

Milky Moo:
i don't even count t56-1 as a gun

Kyle:
if you scrap 5 famas' in succession, you get g11

Milky Moo:
she's just a knockoff AK

Kyle:
its a sacrifice

commie:
I mean if you're comparing with some of the worst 4*s and night rifles then what is the point?

commie:
I can also say that M4 is better AR than M16

suguri:
because some people just see stars = stromg

Milky Moo:
generally that's how it goes

suguri:
and I keep seeing garbage 4*s linked in echelon screenshots

suguri:
a top tier 2* isn't going to beat a top tier 4*

Luxanna:
shaddap and pakyu <:SOPMODfunnyfeic:427804752701554719>

Luxanna:


An0n:
Also G11 vs STAR

suguri:
but it'll beat the garbage 4*s

Milky Moo:
VAL is garbage

commie:
I dunno a 2* AR is kind of tough to justify

commie:
there are a lot of good ARs

Milky Moo:
well

Luxanna:
Val best raifu

Milky Moo:
when f2000 gets a mod 3

Milky Moo:
that'd be cool

Luxanna:
Vol mod 3 when

An0n:
I'm still wondering what M14 Mod III skill is

An0n:
It better be a RoF buff

An0n:
like FN49

commie:
the info is already released

An0n:
üòÆ

An0n:
Whazzit?

commie:
I think they did reveal all 3 mod bonuses when they revealed mod3

commie:
I dunno does it look like I can read moonrunes? üò†

Siege Waifus:
lol

Chiaki:
m14 mod3 skill increases her critical damage

An0n:
NOOOO

Chiaki:
it scales multiplicatively with a cape

An0n:
DAMN IT!

An0n:
DAMN IT ALL TO HELL!

commie:
apparently she's better than an IWS so yeah, there's that

Chiaki:
what

Chiaki:
why are you screaming

suguri:
you just listed the A-team members

suguri:
<:umpOwO:500681384226979840>

Siege Waifus:
tbh I really like the boss only dolls

Luxanna:
And I'd say that when it comes to norminess in theory it's M4 > STAR = SOPPO > M16

suguri:
M4 - Face, M16 - Hannibal, STAR - Murdock, SOP - Baracus

Siege Waifus:
G17, FMG9, CZ, M21, M249

suguri:
<:OK:500692128058572800>

Luxanna:
but in practice it's something like Soppo > Star > m16 > m4

Sunnie:
Yeh forreal sangvis dolls

Luxanna:
so whatevs

Siege Waifus:
Haven't reached 6-6 yet tho

Sunnie:
Architect

Sunnie:
Bae af

Luxanna:
M1A1 is as bae as she is useless

Siege Waifus:
Destroyer tho

art12345:
What

art12345:
M1 is so gud tho

art12345:
???

Siege Waifus:
M1A1 Carbine as a Rifle, omega lul

Luxanna:
same goes for m14

Luxanna:
though

Sunnie:
m14 is actually good

Luxanna:
m1a1 was at least semi automatic

Siege Waifus:
yeah, but M14 fires a rifle round

Sunnie:
and she has a precious smile

commie:
you wouldn't want to fire an M14 full auto

Sunnie:
my shoulder wouldn't like it either

Siege Waifus:
M1 Carbine is basically the P90 today

suguri:
<:OK:500692128058572800>

Luxanna:
<@398561971387236365> so did g3

Luxanna:
for example

Siege Waifus:
yeah

commie:
this is a pointless argument, it's clear that the ingame designations don't correspond to real life roles

Siege Waifus:
obviously

Luxanna:
<@358462916296704010> her tiles and skill are plain out bad

Siege Waifus:
also wasn't trying to say it's wrong

Luxanna:
she also has the lowest fp out of all rfs

Siege Waifus:
just a fun fact lol

Luxanna:
so how is she supposed to be good?

commie:
you might as well say that the m14 t doll is trained for marksmanship while FAL and G3 were trained for a different role, I dunno

Siege Waifus:
fp?

Luxanna:
firepower = damage = fp = dmg

Siege Waifus:
ah

suguri:
use M1A1 together with SM-1

art12345:
Actually

Sunnie:
hmm

art12345:
Should i give up

commie:
in life?

commie:
yeah

Siege Waifus:
no

art12345:
And get f2000 with a singular core?

Kyle:
are you telling me my ak47 isnt blond?

art12345:
It is just 1 core

Luxanna:
yeah

Luxanna:
do it

Luxanna:
whatever

art12345:
How much can it possibly be

Sunnie:
isn't she just a worse version of m14

Luxanna:
it's a 3* <:hkStare2:414084643848192006>

commie:
it's tough to get even one core in the earlier game

art12345:
Will 1 core really make a difference

Siege Waifus:
no

Siege Waifus:
do it

commie:
but yeah 1 core is nothing

art12345:
And why waste 2k ammo

Kyle:
what doll are we scrapping?

art12345:
For 1 fucking f2000

Luxanna:
<@!260901233181720577> who?

Sunnie:
just get ram g

Sunnie:
m1a1

art12345:
No not scraping

Luxanna:
nah

Sunnie:
isn't she just a worse version of m14

Kyle:
f2000?

Luxanna:
m1a1 is a self rof buffer

art12345:
I am retrieving her

Luxanna:
m14 is a self dmg buffer

Siege Waifus:
or just do a map and get F2000 and more dolls for enhancements

Chiaki:
yeah retrieve her it's just one core

Chiaki:
lol

suguri:
m1a1 and sm-1 are both long uptime rof buffers

Luxanna:
m1a1 is a worse wawa / dragunov

art12345:
I did the map bs

Sunnie:
oh you right

art12345:
I wasted like 500 ammo

commie:
recovering a 2*?

Sunnie:
for some reason I thought she had the same skill as wa2k

commie:
do you really need her?

Luxanna:
<@!219680275402194945> the thing is that long uptime rof buffs are still worse than wawas skill

suguri:
I never said she was good

commie:
she's in AR set 1

Chiaki:
hmm

Chiaki:
why do you say that, vol

suguri:
she's login doll tier

commie:
she'll show up whenever you try to do AR, SMG, RF or MG recipe

Chiaki:
you'll have to explain why long uptime rof buffs are a bad thing

An0n:
Also Wa has a weird thing of her max RoF is 108...

Luxanna:
<@358462916296704010> why don't you just hobo run 0 2

Luxanna:
several times?

An0n:
Hobo run?

fdavanzo:
Not so easy I loose all but one doll group to finish her off when I'm lucky

Siege Waifus:
the 1000 strength one?

Chiaki:
E1 is 2 turns

Chiaki:
<:thonk9:410657576892497930>

c3:
to confirm, you mean the first event map?

An0n:
Node 1

c3:
^ yeah, that's 2 turns

An0n:
It takes 3 for me ._.

Chiaki:
what are you doing

An0n:
how do you do it in two >.>

Chiaki:
go up top to the heliport

Siege Waifus:
oh

c3:
deplory one squad, move it up 2 nodes to the next heli, turn end

c3:
next turn go straight for command

An0n:
Oh fuuuu

Sunnie:
Shit you right

Siege Waifus:
jesus

Sunnie:
I've just been bum rushing e1

Chiaki:
LOL

An0n:
I thought it took 3 AP's to get to that one >.>

JohnTitor:
Who's fucking?

Siege Waifus:
but on one guide I saw it said to deploy a squad and go left, deploy another squad and end turn

JohnTitor:
<:RibDiedInside:414195386199179265>

An0n:
I didn't see that line that connects for two...

Sunnie:
That's what I did

An0n:
**Face palms**

Sunnie:
Go left and deploy one

Siege Waifus:
and then on the second turn you could go straight to the boss node, but you actually can't, you're one short

An0n:
I've been sedning a squad to the heliport directly next to HQ

commie:
no it's understandable

An0n:
and going up center

c3:
lesson of the day: don't just blindly trust guides, or for that matter anything other people say

commie:
the node line makes it look like a road

commie:
a proper one

Chiaki:
i'm sure the guides we have here also show two turns

Chiaki:
<:thonk9:410657576892497930>

An0n:
I didn't follow a guide for that one

An0n:
The line on the road blended in =w=

c3:
didn't check, so I'm not commenting

c3:
ugh

Siege Waifus:
I always went right, for the extra heliport, then just fought my way to the S rank map

Sunnie:
Forreal

Siege Waifus:
but thanks for the suggestion lol, should shave some time of the daily grind

Sunnie:
I should've looked at that more closely

Sunnie:
It's what I get for trying to get boxes during lecture

Sunnie:
Smh

Siege Waifus:
lol

An0n:
you don't need an S rank for Node 1 and 2

Siege Waifus:
yeah

An0n:
only 3 and 4 is needed =w=

Chiaki:
only s-rank the fight

Siege Waifus:
but it's to flex

commie:
flex what exactly?

Luxanna:
tehehehe 69

Luxanna:


Siege Waifus:
idk, just flexing

An0n:
Hao2Flex

Sunnie:
super bamboo

commie:
baby hg bamboo too

c3:
needs more thunder

Luxanna:
hao 2 actually flex

Luxanna:
3 vols

Luxanna:
<:BlobReach:414069175934386177>

Sunnie:
What a commitment

commie:
too many vols spoil the uh

An0n:
EN doens't ahve thunder qwq

c3:
sadly

An0n:
I want her

An0n:
I want to pet her

Luxanna:
tfw I wanted to make 5 level 100 STG-44s

Luxanna:
but I will end up with 5 vols

An0n:
Like how I want to hug SOP

Luxanna:
<:thonk9:410657576892497930>

suguri:
why s rank a map that has no special drops

suguri:
<:g36Lazy:481469060589027329>

An0n:
SOP is best AR member

commie:
soppo best tank

Luxanna:
SOP is a normie waifu

Luxanna:
tbh

Luxanna:
the most normie of all ar members

Sunnie:
m4 is more normie

Sunnie:
but no one waifus m4

An0n:
Eeeehhh... STAR edgy... M4 cinnamon bun, M16 a drunkard

Luxanna:
well technically speaking you're right

An0n:
SOP goes through great character development

Sunnie:
m16 looks like solid snake so immediate waifu

Siege Waifus:
of the AR team I like Sop the most

c3:
maniac battle crazed
>normie
<:welrodWhat:500693278484725772>

Siege Waifus:
but I don't like the AR team that much

Sunnie:
RO635

An0n:
Just....

An0n:
*cries light*

Luxanna:
SOP - crazy freak, m4 - everyman, M16 - drunkgirl, STAR - classical edgy girl

Luxanna:
the only anti rain member you cannot describe with 1 sentence is ro I guess

Luxanna:
but I know second to none about her

commie:
megaphone

commie:
done

Siege Waifus:
yeah

Luxanna:
so maybe that's why

Siege Waifus:
ro is more recent, so yeah

c3:
> better ROF than any other AR
<:g11spit:410657877825683456>

An0n:
Ahaaa.

Yorihime:
G11 is special

Siege Waifus:
G11 though

Chiaki:
famas has higher rof than STAR

Yorihime:
Let her sleep

An0n:
```Spikes Tactical 10th Anniversary edition ST-15.```

An0n:
is what STAR is based off of

Chiaki:
famas, f2k,m4,sopmod, HAJIMEMASHITE, 9A

Yorihime:
And FA-MAS is free cores

Siege Waifus:
ah, so that's what ST stands for

Siege Waifus:
FAMAS is a cutie

Chiaki:
despite being designed by spikes tactical she still calls herself Colt AR15

Chiaki:
<:homeThonk:484732324198744097>

An0n:
FAMAS is cute

An0n:
also

An0n:
I want her at level 100

commie:
it's in the name Fusil d'Assaut de la ManufaCORES d'Armes de Saint-√âtienne

An0n:
because of that Halloween skin

An0n:
I keep her jsut for that

Yorihime:
M16A1 also holds a CAR15 variant in her SMOL version

An0n:
Like...

An0n:


An0n:
FAMAS PLEASE!

Siege Waifus:
I have her in my main echelon, with 416, Shrimp, Vector and right now M4A1 for the Elphelt fight, but usually is an handgun

Chiaki:
i thought it was an m4 variant in her chibi

An0n:
?

An0n:
Why not a RF suqad for Elphelt?

Vinen:
FAMAS

Vinen:
still useless

Siege Waifus:
you guys got Famas, we got Type 64

Vinen:
even with that skin

Siege Waifus:
though I love her witch costume, so I don't mind

+Neptune+ (Lawyer-san):
Halloween famas

+Neptune+ (Lawyer-san):
Well

+Neptune+ (Lawyer-san):
<:fncFat:502098769379196928>

An0n:
Like

An0n:
Holy hell FAMAS... Love the skin =w=

An0n:
Looks dope AF

An0n:
I just need a skin for SOP and I will Whale

Yorihime:
The best skin is Elphelt's skin

An0n:
so hard

An0n:
Like how I'm gonna whale for Vectors skin

An0n:
Vectors Wedding...

Siege Waifus:
And my experience with Elphelt fight is that it drives me crazy with the micromanagement of a bamboo squad, and for pure DPS rifles, I don't have any leveled up for that

An0n:
?

An0n:
Aaaahh

An0n:
Bamboo doesn't work since her skill

Siege Waifus:
doesn't?

An0n:
With a 5 link M14 and WA I can kill her before her first skill

An0n:
Well

An0n:
They can work jsut...

Chiaki:
it works if you oneshot her before 50% hp

Nunk:
i hope the gfl anime turns out well

Nunk:
i like my cute girls with a healthy dose of suffering

Siege Waifus:
well, I only have 416 and M2HB 5 linked, so

An0n:
M14 and WA makes thigns easy

An0n:
Calico only becomes taiha'd

Siege Waifus:
That's what I keep trying, but either I do it wrong, or I just don't have the skill to pull it off

Yorihime:
I just go straight into the fight with LeeWSodia

An0n:
Yee

Siege Waifus:
I tried NTW-20, PTRD, buffed by Welrod, Type 59 and PPK at first, and then MP446 for even more damage, but when the skill activates and they shoot Elphelt,  her skill still triggers

Yorihime:
Don't let her skill trigger

Siege Waifus:
bruh

Siege Waifus:
no shit

An0n:
I'm surprised you don't have a high level M14 o.o

An0n:
Thought that was usually priority

Siege Waifus:
I mean, they shoot her close to 50% hp, but only brings her down to ~25hp, it's like it still triggers for some reason

An0n:
Ah

An0n:
That's the problem

Chiaki:
if you oneshot her, it won't trigger

fdavanzo:
Hello all I've got a question since I can't s-rank Elphelt to get the 2 magic boxs is it normal to not pull any more 3 star t-dolls once I've cleared the stage?

An0n:
Big Bamboo squads needs Grizzly and SAA

Chiaki:
all you gotta do is move your RFs a bit so they don't shoot

An0n:
and Mk23

Yorihime:
I always have to move one doll on 9 6 3 otherwise her skill trigger tho

Siege Waifus:
it's still a level 80 NTW and level 70 PTRD

Chiaki:
and then let them explode her

Siege Waifus:
with lvl 7 skills

Mega252:
Ptrd?

An0n:
o.o

Siege Waifus:
but it just doesn't do enough damage, though it should, or the mechanics have changed

Yorihime:
Like I just move my Calico on 6 during the fight and with enough luck I can end the fight without taking a single dmg

Siege Waifus:
my Grizzly is level 30, so...

Siege Waifus:
same for MK23

Yorihime:
Then go 0-2

Siege Waifus:
but MP446 and Type59 do give some nice buffs

An0n:
Though prioritize getting Mk23, SAA, and Griz to at least 4 link

An0n:
it's well worth it

An0n:
Same with PPK

Siege Waifus:
didn't do the math, but from the top of my head, NTW would dish over 200 damage, so with the skill, that's 6x her damage, it's a lot of HP

An0n:
Elephant has a lot of health =w=

Siege Waifus:
plus, at least one hg had to withdraw or die before their skills are even ready to be activated, so it's not the best strat for me

Sheodoq:
Just kill her before she shoots ez

An0n:
Why is Node 1 grind so... drustratin?

An0n:
Why must it take 3 turns to complete...

c3:
3?

Siege Waifus:
but whatever, this SMGAR does the job, unless she targets my tanks, which means another doll has to take the damage, and reduces the chances for a S rank

An0n:
1 to get the squads, 1 to move them up to into position 1 stop away and 1 to kill the boss and cap base

Siege Waifus:
1st battle you mean?

Sparkee100:
She just looks Kool that's all

Siege Waifus:
yup

An0n:
CZ = Axe YEETer

NZ = ....?

Siege Waifus:
only good chinese hg is Type 92

Chiaki:
you mean type59

suguri:
type 59

Sparkee100:
The glasses loli is powerhouse

Siege Waifus:
well, technically it's the same as NZ75, it's the chinese Makarov

Siege Waifus:
Type 92 is actually chinese designed, so...

suguri:
you mean good irl or good ingame

An0n:
Type100 when

Rose ‚ôß:
Sex.

Siege Waifus:
good visually

suguri:
<a:t100SEX:474508533442936833>

Siege Waifus:
chinese weapons are average at best

Siege Waifus:
irl

Siege Waifus:
don't know about the most recent ones though

An0n:
Type-88 is fun

An0n:
Jsut

An0n:
240b > Type-88

An0n:
Also when will we get a FN MAG or a M240b

Siege Waifus:
Deagle, SCAR, M240 and HK417 are some of the weapons missing still

suguri:
the strongest weapon china ever made is this shovel 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGdbbEZVHqw

Yorihime:
We need a SPIW project prototype to surpass S.F troops

Yorihime:


suguri:
<:OK:500692128058572800>

McSparky:
Do we have L96?

Siege Waifus:
ah yes, no L96/L115

Siege Waifus:
we also need

Siege Waifus:
Intervention as well

Yorihime:
I don't know why there isn't any AI series firearms when their most famous model is literally named "Arctic Warfare"

Siege Waifus:
lol

McSparky:
Also no CheyTac Intervention

Siege Waifus:
tbh, P90 took a long way to show up, considering FiveseveN is in the game as well

Siege Waifus:
also, more revolvers

Yorihime:
I mean the game is centered around cute 2d girls using firearms and there was a real opportunity to put any AI AW rifle but no

An0n:
I mean

Siege Waifus:
S&W M1917, S&W M29, Colt Python

An0n:
the HK417 is *technically* in the game

Siege Waifus:
maybe even older ones

Sparkee100:
No m700

Siege Waifus:
The Texas Revolver

Yorihime:
We are already flooded with AR15 variants

Yorihime:
Is it American Market Frontline

Siege Waifus:
LeMats

Siege Waifus:
yeah

+Neptune+ (Lawyer-san):
Smol declares wah on JP

An0n:
Isn't Mk12 a AR-15/M16 varient/

+Neptune+ (Lawyer-san):
We will have Carcanos

Siege Waifus:
tbh M4A1 and M4 Sopmod are pretty much the same

Yorihime:
Yes

+Neptune+ (Lawyer-san):
<:SOPMODfunnyfeic:427804752701554719>

An0n:
Yee

An0n:
Though Soppo is Toppo

Yorihime:
We have a ton of AR15 variants in the game

Sparkee100:
We don't have Winchester

An0n:
Soppo is Chad Vs. Virgin m4

An0n:
*dabs*

Siege Waifus:
lol

Yorihime:
As well as a lot of AK variants

suguri:
sop is the new recruit that slaps on all the attachments he can carry on his rails

Yorihime:
Now do one variant per country so we can do a really viable AK team

Yorihime:
<:sealSmug:414085422277328896>

Siege Waifus:
yeah, but other than AK-47 and the Type-56-1, most are different from one another

Yorihime:
No there is also AK-12 and Galil

Siege Waifus:
thought Type56-1 has a folding stock

Sparkee100:
Ak12 <:OK:500692128058572800>

Sparkee100:
Umu12 bestest

An0n:
Honestly the SOPMOD 2 isn't even that much. EOTech, IR laser, angled fore grip

Yorihime:
As well as Saiga

Siege Waifus:
while M4 and Sopmod are identical

Sparkee100:
Sopmod is basically my gun in PD2

Siege Waifus:
no, I mean that Sopmod is basically a name for a modified M4

Yorihime:
There is the AKS-74u too

Siege Waifus:
which M4A1 already is a modified M4

Sparkee100:
M14ebr when

An0n:
Special Operations Modification Block 2

An0n:
is the SOPMOD

Siege Waifus:
yes

An0n:
Ooohh... ``Special Operations Peculiar MODification``

Siege Waifus:
though I shouldn't be having this discussion, it's not my area of expertise, it's just what I think it is, I could be wrong

Sparkee100:
Toxic cloud dolls when?

An0n:
M4 and SOP are technically the same though

An0n:
Just.

Yorihime:
mustard gas Mod III

An0n:
One's a regular M4 and SOP is a Block 2 kit

An0n:
and Soppo is cuter

Siege Waifus:
and STAR is just a semi auto M16

An0n:
Actualy

An0n:
STAR is special

Yorihime:
A semi auto AR15 having a better ROF than any other AR

Siege Waifus:
can't use global emotes here? üò≠

An0n:
She's a specially built AR15 for a comemorative thing

Yorihime:
And having a self buff

Siege Waifus:
lol

Yorihime:
On ROF

Yorihime:
Is it the ultimate ATF trolling AR15?

Siege Waifus:
ha!

Chiaki:
her base rate of fire isn't that high

Chiaki:
though she's almost always capped thanks to her skill

An0n:
Any idea who the new girl will be?

suguri:
a hg

Sparkee100:
Negev squad Jerico

An0n:
She's a HG but... reminds me of Negev for some reason...

An0n:
So that means...

An0n:
could it be a Jericho 941?

Chiaki:
it is a jericho

Sparkee100:
But she has the Jewish star

Sparkee100:
So can't be deagle

An0n:

suguri:
you can blame her less than spectacular specs on being a free login hg

An0n:
Is Scorpion any good?

An0n:
Evo3

suguri:
frankly I don't have a clue what her tile formation was supposed to be

Chiaki:
evo3? nah

An0n:
Boo

An0n:
Also I just realized how small Evo3 is

An0n:
The gun is massive in her hands

An0n:
She's as small as Kar -w-

Siege Waifus:
Smol redhead cutie with glasses

Sparkee100:
Scar when

Chiaki:
she's like a dedicated defensive handgun, which is a problem because you generally pack handguns for burst

Chiaki:
she can help you survive a lot i guess

Chiaki:
may be good for bosses

An0n:
NZ75 good....?

An0n:
other than the "Did you drop the Bronze NZ75 or the Gold NZ75" meme

Chiaki:
she's fine

Sparkee100:
I got nz75 skin from single pull

Sparkee100:

Sparkee100:

Chiaki:
she's like at the bottom of the 5* handgun power rankings, though

Siege Waifus:
I missed CZ75 for just a couple of day to get the points on her event, so now I got the chinese copy of her, so that's something

An0n:
oof

Vinen:

CE is a lie

tbh we don't even need to collab with any other games to use heavier ordnance

the setting isn't so restrictive to limit the characters to anthromorphized guns

if a gacha game as pointless as star ocean could get a nier collab, I don't see why we shouldn't be able to

forgot about 5-4

Chiaki:
sent to both

HazardousJay:
<@!474005183714689045> if you only need parts, then add 5-4 on the logi's

Chiaki:
5-4 is 7 hours long, isn't it

HazardousJay:
yeah

Chiaki:
and it's still less parts than 4-2

HazardousJay:
4-2 is 210 per 2 hours, so its like

c3:
by 5

Chiaki:
by not a lot

Chiaki:
the problem is that he doesn't have maxed echelon for logi

c3:
difference is that 5-4 can also drop doll tickets

Chiaki:
so more tries for a great success would be a better deal <:thonk9:410657576892497930>

I'd be sad aboutnot having rib but eh, don't have enough dmg buff ARs to use with her anyway

commie:
you hear that, game? gib g36 ples

Jazaia Taizago:
Grinding levels. Manpower falling down like nothing, making equipment to upgrade other equipment, and get some pieces i'm missing. Once done with EXP Stages. Chapter 4 to do, and get to 70 so i can do Elphelt more safely.

commie:
are you doing 10x4 equip pulls for fodder?

JohnTitor:
I'm actually running low on parts lul

c3:
nope, I give up. tried a faithful adoption of yukata groza, but it just ends up looking weird

JohnTitor:
<:welrodWhat:500693278484725772>

you should be farming low quality equips instead on night missions

Jazaia Taizago:
Don't have resources for that. About 5k now. I'm done one by one each time on the Factory.

Jazaia Taizago:
Eeeeeeh. True.

Jazaia Taizago:
Just slightly busy gathering EXP now.

commie:
use the contracts to roll for proper equips

Jazaia Taizago:
Contracts? Perhaps something i've missed.

commie:
and then come here to cry about getting a stupid amount of one kind of equip

commie:
i don't need more ap ammo thanks mica

Jazaia Taizago:
I've had the tendency to get a lot of Night Visions, Scopes and sometimes Armor Pieces.

Jazaia Taizago:
Also getting a bunch of SG ammo.

commie:
crit scopes are always welcome tbh

commie:
you want them on pretty much every AR and RF

Jazaia Taizago:
I have a good number of those. Put them on my M14 and SOPMOD.

Also one on my FAL.

Is 16lab high velocity ammo any good?

Kid:
groza's skin is more well known than her base

JohnTitor:
I'm pretty sure I don't need 16 Gold AP

Reaper:
Wuts the difference than a normal 5star high velocity

Kid:
that it might as well be her base

c3:
16lab is just 5* equip pre-calibrated

commie:
I've been running ammo recipe but I only get ap and sg ammo

oooo

suguri:
it's a hv with special red text

suguri:
<:OK:500692128058572800>

So it's the same one tho right?

Statistic wise

suguri:
that means it's better than the pedestrian trash you pull from production

Kid:
unless you retreat before she begins it

Chiaki:
but she does aim from 3 to 9

Chiaki:
but if someone was at 9 and no one was at 3 and you move someone to 3 during the animation, 9 will get shot

Chiaki:
she locks on before shooting

suguri:
I just meant if she had a definite aiming priority and not just random

suguri:
like geonosis

commie:
it's the most well-known rifle with that stylw of bolt

Kid:

Kid:
cropped parts of the dolls' LEG

dropkick_tm:
Oh thats the preview

dropkick_tm:
Not a leak

Kid:
it's prooviews

commie:
I don't know the way mica does things so I assumed it was a leak

commie:
I mean, what kind of preview only shows the grip of a deagle :V

dropkick_tm:


Kid:
ye

Kid:
it's called a

Kid:
TEASER

Kid:

commie:

dropkick_tm:
I see a revolver

Kid:
ye

commie:
where?

Kid:
it's a teaser

dropkick_tm:
Check the grip logo

dropkick_tm:
Maybe its a big clue

commie:
checkthe grip shape

commie:
that might also be a clue

Chiaki:
it's iwi jericho

Chiaki:
the pistol

Kid:
oh no whim

dropkick_tm:
No i mean check the grip logo it might give us the brand

Kid:
what have you done

commie:
it's not a revolver

dropkick_tm:
Oh crap not a revolver

dropkick_tm:
I thought the shape is one

commie:
its shape is consistent with the desert eagla family of handguns

Kid:
guys

Nihilo:
It‚Äôs already foreshadowed as Jericho. DE would have to wait for her time to come.

Nihilo:
Sure ain‚Äôt it now.

Kid:
my shrimp exodia isn't working

Kid:
g41 is killing shit before her

dropkick_tm:
Darnnit no juan diego

Kid:
also

dropkick_tm:
No awp too

Kid:
didn't deagle fucking DIE

Kid:
before the plot began

dropkick_tm:
You mean deep dive?

Chiaki:
the game also mentions that negev got her dressing style from jericho, and the pistol is all in white there, and it's also negev's artist

Chiaki:
it all hints to jericho

Nihilo:
DE was never mentioned in any capacity.

Kid:
negev's artist uses this

Kid:
weird lighting

somerandom101person:
Need the event to end to spam those logistic support.

dropkick_tm:
So jericho got repaired?

Nihilo:
It‚Äôs a lore thing.

Nihilo:
But in a short word.

Nihilo:
Yeah.

dropkick_tm:
Jericho a yandere then?

Shatterstar Nova:
silver war portrait format

Kid:
also i thought DE was mentioned already

Kid:
well i thought wrong

Chiaki:
no mentions of deagle

Shatterstar Nova:
something something not jpg.

dropkick_tm:
Shes gonna be a yandere too

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
to almost doom slayer

AWACS Sky Eye:
What'cha discussing about?

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
story development

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
I guess?

Kid:
about how M4 went from a cinnamon roll

Kid:
to the weapon to surpass hydras

Kid:
also M-Not-Inori-82A1's design

AWACS Sky Eye:
Not Inori best.

AWACS Sky Eye:
Even her backstory kinda matches.

Kid:
sausage redjuice

AWACS Sky Eye:
What with her (M82) having a cult like followers.

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
eh....

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
what's M82A1's skill again?

Kid:
dunno

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
probably a bamboo

AWACS Sky Eye:
And she tried to distance herself from it.

Kid:
Grants 3 special bullets each battle, 1 bullet will be consumed upon each skill usage. Aim for 1 second and deal 4.2x damage. The last bullet will deal double damage and reduce target damage by 20% for 5 seconds. Every victory in the current mission will increase skill damage by 10%, up to 3 layers.

Kid:
thx helian

Kid:
oh she's like jhin from legolas

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
what the hell

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
is that skill

Kid:
something

T√∂nshi:
Overcomplication

Kid:
i like m82a1

Kid:
i would use her even if she was bad

Kid:
how is that complicated

Kid:
you have 3 bullets

Kid:
you use 1 per skill use

Kid:
and you gain damage as you win/kill shit

Kid:
<:thonk9:410657576892497930>

salty emp:
still overcomplication

Kid:
is it

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
thing is

salty emp:
complicated for the sake of being complicated

Kid:
or are you just lazy to read

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
it doesn't state

T√∂nshi:
4.2/4.2/8.4 base isn't bad I guess

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
whether M82 is in the victory

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
or any team win counts toward the buff

Kid:
dunno i'll ask someone

T√∂nshi:
LUUL

Kid:
<@!194978774155001857> hey sentry explain us plebs how it works

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
> pinging stasi

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
<:RibBleeding:415391866822066176>

T√∂nshi:
Either way it'll cap out at 10x damage on last shot which is alright

20thSentryFox:
for what? m82?

Kid:
ye

20thSentryFox:
Seems like your explanations are fine

20thSentryFox:
<:springTea:427818533431410691>

Kid:
nice

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
but what about my question

T√∂nshi:
But does it count all victories or victories obtained by her echelon

T√∂nshi:
WuttuW

Ashina:
<@139251378005606401> might be Actually Satan

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
that one is important

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
it'll decide how good she is at bossing

Kid:
i would bet at ea victory with her participating

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
if that's the case then her value goes down

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
since she needs build-up

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
and she's a bamboo <:RibBleeding:415391866822066176>

salty emp:
the chinese version leans to every victory in the mission

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
which means she's not suitable for mobbing

Kid:
<:thonk9:410657576892497930>

salty emp:
but mica is absolute godlike at being unclear

Kid:
then she's coolio

salty emp:
soooooo

Kid:
ye

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
but if she wants to be at best she has to kill mobs

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
-> endless cycle

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
if she builds up with any team

salty emp:
i heard she was actually a good choice at killing gundams

Kid:
i mean

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
then she's a major boss killer

Kid:
it's not like she needs

Kid:
to stack up her damage

Kid:
it's just an option

Kid:
<:thonk9:410657576892497930>

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
no

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
a bamboo has to be at best

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
in 1 shot

Kid:
well use goddamn grapejuice then

Ashina:


20thSentryFox:
m82 will is more anti-gundam, than bamboo

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
what would the buffs be useful for if she can't even bring out full damage at once

20thSentryFox:
ü§î

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
how so

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
ü§î

Kid:
dunno

Kid:
kar is anti-gundam too no?

dropkick_tm:
Sentry voodoo pls

Ashina:
450x4

Ashina:
Do it

20thSentryFox:
kar doesn't do as much damage as m82 tho, also has a longer initial cd

Kid:
well that's twisted

Ashina:
Kar is Small

Kid:
isn't kar like

Kid:
fucking 1.8m

Ashina:
She's smol

20thSentryFox:
not even 1.8m

20thSentryFox:
less than 1.5m iirc

Aydensnake:
Welp, there goes the only gun that could've been used in a S.T.A.L.K.E.R collab

T√∂nshi:
BFG

Aydensnake:
>Doom collab

Aydensnake:
DO IT

Kid:
we would be doomed if that happened ay

T√∂nshi:
Technically M4 is Doomslayer already

T√∂nshi:
M4 *SOPMOD*, that is

T√∂nshi:
She rips and tears until it's done

Ashina:
Valkyria chronicles collab
Gallian costume for some dolls

Aydensnake:
Wait, a S.T.A.L.K.E.R collab could just give costumes to the guns that appeared in the series

Ospreysz:
Batts war

T√∂nshi:
Oh shit I forgot

Ospreysz:
Its kinda unusual i get all 10 dorms batteries without worrying about me not get them all

T√∂nshi:
We don't have rocket launcher support units in GFL yet

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
we do

Ospreysz:
Sooon

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
ain't they the mortars?

Ospreysz:
We have that

Ospreysz:
Yes

T√∂nshi:
Rocket launchers, not mortars

T√∂nshi:
As in RPG-9, Stinger etc.

Ospreysz:
M4 bazzooka is not enough?

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
then you have to wait until we have something like

Ospreysz:
<:RibBleeding:415391866822066176>

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
gundams

Aydensnake:
S.T.A.L.K.E.R collab when?
Could even have one of the new T-Dolls be a rare example of a female stalker taken directly from the zone

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
those damned things

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
frighten me

T√∂nshi:
If we're making a game about guns don't cut the presentation short

T√∂nshi:
Get the rocket and missile launchers in

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
OH SHIT RPG!!!!

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
I can hear that somewhere

Aydensnake:
Not to mention both games are set in Ukraine, Chernobyl mission when?

T√∂nshi:
We already have a giant energy cannon blasting our echelons to begin with

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
imagine HG-RPG echelons

T√∂nshi:
GFL's in Ukraine what

T√∂nshi:
I thought it was generalized as being in and around Europe

Ospreysz:
Its kinda weird we not have something explosive against cannon or heavy armored robots

T√∂nshi:
We do, but still very limited to skills and support units

Aydensnake:
nah, apparently it's in Ukraine. Or at least G&K is based in Ukraine

T√∂nshi:
Not t-dolls outright

T√∂nshi:
G&K being in Ukraine makes sense, but the plot takes you literally everywhere

deadlymessenger:
the player name type in screen where you go to on first login has Ukraine reference all over the place iirc

Kid:
wait

Kid:
holy shit

Kid:
what the fuck

T√∂nshi:
Late realization that M4 has Doomslayer's color palette

T√∂nshi:
Unless theyre hardcore christian

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:

T√∂nshi:
It's no Az*r L*ne so it's fine

Ashina:
Yea...

Nihilo:
Better to keep that to yourself, Ashina.

Ashina:
Wait

Nihilo:
Among whatever else is gonna come outta your mouth.

Ashina:
MG5 is not censored while PTRD is censored

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
what are you talking about

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
she is censored

Ashina:
Hm?

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
MG5 is censored

Kirisa:
yeah she's censored

Ashina:
The non damaged art

Kirisa:


Slave to the Caffeine:

Slave to the Caffeine:

Slave to the Caffeine:
<:springTea:427818533431410691>

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
MG5 is censored while colt is not

Ashina:
Most censors are clevage

Ashina:
And extra skins

Shatterstar Nova:
you want real uncensor?

Shatterstar Nova:
spectre m4

Ashina:
Hon hon

Ashina:
From bra to tank top

Ashina:
The worst censor is probably that 3* German WW2 pistol

Ashina:
That one who get a full suit

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
eh...which one?

Ashina:
C something

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
C96?

Ashina:
Maybe

Ashina:
Its a 3* pistol

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
the one that was supposed to wear a bra only

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
and they gave a full suit?

Ashina:
Yee

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
right that one

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
I remember it

Ashina:
<:RibDiedInside:414195386199179265>

Ashina:

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
how do you lose a box

ok but remember the alamo?:

ok but remember the alamo?:
mmmmm

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
you either gain it or spend it

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
I have never heard of anyone losing it

ok but remember the alamo?:
i need to keep better track of what i run

Shatterstar Nova:
you didn't reach S rank fighting bosses

Shatterstar Nova:

Ashina:

Ashina:
More like purple capsule box without the capsule

PyreAmp:
7:45 hmm <:thonk9:410657576892497930>

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
what do you mean without the capsule

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
you open it

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
there are capsules inside

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
it says

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
"PILLS HERE"

Ashina:
I wonder what does the enchantment capsule taste like

Ashina:
<:thonk9:410657576892497930>

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
taste like chicken

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:

oh i was looking at something else

Kirisa:
guess i gotta save up more gems

Kirisa:
was hyped for 10th dorm

Kirisa:
what am i even gonna use echelon 10 for...

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
never enough echelon, my friend

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
I would gladly grind for 10 echelons

Kirisa:
4 in logistics, 2 in auto, 2 leveling/clearing teams

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
and send them all to battle

Kirisa:
and a 1 HG echelon

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
4 logistic, 2 auto, 2 corpse drags, 2 combat ready

Kirisa:
technically i could have only one leveling echelon

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
that's how I'm gonna use 10 echelons

Kirisa:
but i rotate to save quick repairs

Kirisa:
2 corpse drag but no 1HG team?

Kirisa:
rip resources

Kirisa:
<:SOPMODfunnyfeic:427804752701554719>

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
to me

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
there's no need for 1HG team

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
only search and destroy

Kirisa:
i run 0-2 only

Kirisa:
havent touched 0-4

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
I run 0-4 for weekly boss

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
then back to massive 0-2

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
but since elphelt happened I haven't returned to 0-4

Kirisa:
i've been slacking on event

Kirisa:
college...

Kirisa:
<:SOPMODfunnyfeic:427804752701554719>

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
only college and you slack on events?

Ashina:
I'm in college

Kirisa:
and other stuff

Ashina:
And I don't slack in events

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
you need more training, my friend

Kirisa:
but its a main thing

Kirisa:
since nearing finals week

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
<- professor in uni

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
still playing GFL daily

Ashina:
<- procrastinator

Ashina:
Still does his homework 2 days before its due

Kirisa:
i procrastinate by wasting time in meaningless games like overwatch

Kirisa:
<:RibBleeding:415391866822066176>

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
be in my place

Ashina:
Ew

Ashina:
Ovarwatchto

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
having to answer calls from students

Kirisa:
new hero, wanted to try it out

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
to ask for advice for projects and thesis

Ashina:
I wonder how's it like to be a prof in Uni

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
right when I'm in the middle of elphelt combat

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
<:SOPMODfunnyfeic:427804752701554719>

Ashina:
Rap battle to make your score better

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
> in the middle of elphelt fight

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
> ok I'm gonna kite just 1 doll to-......

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
> call from student

Kirisa:
tell them to make their project on how 2D waifus take over ppls' lives

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
"maybe I should give this student a F"

Kirisa:
<:springTea:427818533431410691>

Akuma:
screw this student <:GudaCano:427805886757601280>

Akuma:
GFL > students

Ashina:
But you might lose ur job

Ashina:
No job no

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
sometimes

Ashina:
Money for Kalina

T√∂nshi:
GFL takes away my time to illustrate my comic and deadline approaches closer

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
I play GFL during exams

T√∂nshi:
But its GFL so its fine

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
since no one's watching

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
<:springTea:427818533431410691>

Ashina:
<:g11spit:410657877825683456>

Ashina:
Wat?

Ashina:
Hw

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
well yeah I have to watch over exams

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
so

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
lots of free time

Ashina:
Oh, right it makes sense

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
just 0-2 planning and pretend I'm watching over the exam

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
seriously

Ashina:
What professor are you?

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
a good one

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
<:GudaCano:427805886757601280>

Kirisa:
<:suomiNANI:414084644322017280>

Ashina:
What course

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
language course

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
so it's quite casual

Akuma:
"The Art of T-Dolls"

Akuma:
<:GudaCano:427805886757601280>

T√∂nshi:
Still tho you couldn't possibly not slack unless your work's piling up

Ashina:
I might want to be a game professor in my college

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
fun fact

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
being a professor

Ashina:
Yes there's a professor who teach games

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
gives you lots of chances to slack

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
except exam period

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
<:RibBleeding:415391866822066176>

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
imagine running 0-2 while making exams

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
no re-do

Nihilo:
Keep it nominal, pretty much.

Nihilo:
Technically nothing wrong with attrition.

Nihilo:
Just that it‚Äôs more wasteful.

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
not worth it

Nihilo:
When you gotta repair and spawn another squad.

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
also it'll affect the score

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
I suppose

Nihilo:
For normal content.

Nihilo:
Doesn‚Äôt matter.

Nihilo:
Might for ranked.

Nihilo:
Since evacuation and failed battles chunk your score.

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
time to grind even harder

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
I don't think RoF or FP self-buff RFs might cut it

Nihilo:
Works fine on Gager.

Nihilo:
But time to kill isn‚Äôt as suitable for Architect.

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
so it has to be bamboo

Nihilo:
Only if you choose to do it.

Nihilo:
AR-SMG is acceptable too.

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
I take the best bet

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
the less risk the better

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
for anti-boss bamboo

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
full damage is the way?

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
is any RoF needed?

Nihilo:
Not really, since they already shot like molasses. You want to capitalize on the kill potential not rate.

Nihilo:
So as much damage as you could buff on.

Nihilo:
Also depends on the boss.

Nihilo:
Armor is the norm for event bosses.

Nihilo:
So that does lengthen the battle quite a bit.

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
so something like

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
grizzly welrod and mk23

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
for the HGs?

Nihilo:
Sure, Welrod is a nice tank given her Debuff can make the target more vulnerable.

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
<:RibBleeding:415391866822066176> üëå

Chaotix:
i wanted to rank for the next event how many sg mg  echelong should I have

Chaotix:
should I level also spirfire too

Mega252:
If you dont plan to just run dupes of the top tier hgs then yeah lvl spitfire

Mega252:
Her tiles give good buffs to mgs and work just fine in a 1sg 2hg 2mg squad or 2sg 1hg 2mg

Mega252:
Plus she look cool since shes got a steampunk vibe

Haru_Ria:
Whose in 3:45?

Akuma:
<:40wave:425688663939219476> btw

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
just go dupe

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
dupe is the way

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
life gives you lemon, you make lemon pancakes

Chaotix:
already have a dupe mg5

Chaotix:
but i feel its not enough

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
get a dupe PK

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
and a M2HB

Chaotix:
fuck

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
or

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
a PKP

august99us:
i'm r e d y for rank

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
I'm not ready yet

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
<:roCry:414084703323160576>

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
I need 10 teams

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
10 lvl 100 teams

T√∂nshi:
I just want my scope and thats it tbh

august99us:
you don't need to rank all that high to get the scope ^^

T√∂nshi:
Ye

august99us:
well unless you want the top tier one i guess

august99us:
though that's still 10%

T√∂nshi:
EN comp pool wont be that high unless its total active players instead of pure total players

T√∂nshi:
In which case my wallet can be sacrificed again

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
should be total players

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
who joined the rank

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
basically

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
more people = easier

august99us:
yea it's total people who played the rank map

august99us:
unless they change that

august99us:
coming to en

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
but

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
it's

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
grinding

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
<:roCry:414084703323160576>

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
ranking based on performance is fine

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
but ranking based on grinding is

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
way too ridiculous

Kirisa:
am i missing something or are dorm slots not in the shop?

Kirisa:
and yes, i am in infrastructure

T√∂nshi:
Infrastructure, Dorm Limit

Kirisa:
i literally dont see dorm limit for some reason

Kirisa:


Kirisa:
i even scroll down and all i see is echelon preset

Kirisa:


Kirisa:
i have 9 dorms

SleepyDuck:
Hahahaha

Kirisa:
i wanna buy my 10th dorm

Kirisa:
<:SOPMODfunnyfeic:427804752701554719>

Saitama:
Wew

Scroubignon:
You can't have more dorms than echelons, that's probably why

Kirisa:
oh, so i have to get my 10th echelon

Chrose:
Aw

Mei:
new day I suppose

Ashina:
Damnit I'm late

Ashina:
Attack my dolls

Chrose:
<:roCry:414084703323160576> what I get for procrastinating I guess

Ashina:
Attack!!

Bladedknight:
I am very frustrated with no SAT8

august99us:
i am very frustrated with no g11

The Laughing Man:
What aug you still don't have G11

The Laughing Man:
How

august99us:
yes

august99us:
i'm still g11-less reeeee :beer16:

The Laughing Man:
I guess that's how karma hits you for getting SAT

august99us:
üëÄ what sat8

The Laughing Man:
<:RibDiedInside:414195386199179265>

Rievakins:
what hg would be best used with wa/sd?

Rievakins:
calico,welrod and grizzly?

The Laughing Man:
Yeah those are the classics

Rievakins:
will calico and welrod be able to max out their rof?

Rievakins:
or is it overkill?

The Laughing Man:
No

The Laughing Man:
After the UI update

The Laughing Man:
They don't max out their RoFs anymore

Rievakins:
even with welrod and calico?

The Laughing Man:
Yeah

Rievakins:
wa maxes out her rof with calico so now thats a big difference huh?

Rievakins:
What do you recommend?

The Laughing Man:
If you want to max out their RoFs, you use Welrod, Five-seven, and Mk23

The Laughing Man:
Like this

The Laughing Man:
WA Mk23
5-7 Welrod
SVD

Rievakins:
mk23?

Rievakins:
for damage?

The Laughing Man:
For damage

Rievakins:
well no 5-7 tbh

The Laughing Man:
You can substitute with Stechkin

Rievakins:
yeah

Rievakins:
why not grizzly tho? She can buff welrod's dodge as well

The Laughing Man:
Grizzly goes in 5-7's/Stechkin's spot

Rievakins:
was thinking of the + formation tbh

Rievakins:
but sure

The Laughing Man:
And if you put Grizzly beside Welrod, she doesn't buff the RFs

Rievakins:
wait so you're telling me stechkin and 5-7 are better than calico?

The Laughing Man:
Mmmm

The Laughing Man:
That's what ask-help says

The Laughing Man:
I haven't tried out that formation yet

The Laughing Man:
Cause my SVD is stuck at 90

Rievakins:
tbh I know that other hg may give more benefit given that they buff fp over acc

Rievakins:
so could be that

The Laughing Man:
Honestly, use whatever you have

Rievakins:
thing is I have all of em outside of 5-7

Rievakins:
only missing contender tbh

The Laughing Man:
In that case you can just go with the classic formation

The Laughing Man:
EN's content doesn't require the maximum potential of RFs right now

The Laughing Man:
And I'm not sure if future content requires it either

Nihilo:
No more than sparingly use of it in ranks.

Nihilo:
AR-SMG takes point man in all regards.

Nihilo:
Although for AW, you can use RFs - namely Big Bamboo - to cut down on the cut in/length of Architect‚Äôs fight.

Nihilo:
Provided she doesn‚Äôt gank you out right with the normal nukes.

Nihilo:
Luxury option.

Nihilo:
Just not the one most would suggest to use, optimally.

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
can the big bamboo cut short the fight with architect

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
namely

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
OHK?

Nihilo:
Close to it.

Nihilo:
If you use like 2.

Nihilo:
M99 and NTW.

Nihilo:
Although I used one at the time.

Rievakins:
tbh my ar team is 
soppo/m16
m14/ingram
g41

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
how about M99/mommyfield?

Nihilo:
Walk was of the chore.

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
will they cut it?

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
<:thonk9:410657576892497930>

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
*since I don't have NTW*

Rievakins:
>not using mosin

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
no chip

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
can't hope to use nugget

Rievakins:
dang

Rievakins:
prepare the mosin

Nihilo:
I‚Äôd go for smaller than since Architect will atomize squads sooner than later. Want faster charge shots before that time comes.

Rievakins:
tbh moist has one of the best injured mod3 art

Sham:
*has ntw but shes still lvl 1*

Nihilo:
The nukes aren‚Äôt instant kills.

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
faster charge shot huh

Nihilo:
But they are crits.

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
so how about this

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
I save their skills

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
then when the team reaches the boss

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
press auto skill

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
so they all shoot at once

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
along with the buff

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
will that do?

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
<:thonk9:410657576892497930>

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
walking is a pain that I know

Nihilo:
Depends on the original status of the squad. If they‚Äôre topped off in HP and Architect wasn‚Äôt pre damaged.

Nihilo:
They can chuck her within reasonable parameters.

Nihilo:
Remember if you do attrition attacks on Bosses with prior squads.

Nihilo:
The next squad to attack will face that Bosses‚Äô cut ins.

Nihilo:
Right on the spot.

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
so it's the same with all bosses with cut-in

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
kill them with 1 try

ribey design notes
```As an answer to the need for Ribeyrolles' personality on ask.

Her clothes is a crude modification based off a patient's clothes (so there should be nothing worn inside [x](She did wear her pantsu). The fabric is connected below her torso, disqualifying her clothes as a [dress]. The wide bands in front of her chest can be detached (as per the picture), so are all tube-type attachments and bandages (according to medical needs).

A typical loli. Barefoot, or it should be said that she didn't have her own shoes at all. A gun that has ceased (production) in the future. Due to numerous defects found in the weapon's design, most of her time in her memory is spent in the infirmary, with few chances of being called to the battlefield.

If G11 spends most of the time sleeping, then Ribeyrolles spends most of the time in a coma. She's barely awake throughout the day, and when she's awake she basically worries whether she will pass out the next second.

Has strong doubts and even disdain of her own existence deep inside. The psychology of Ribeyrolles should be considered twisted. Defects in her chip and her system are numerous, therefore she didn't have an [intact] personality, plus that she has few contacts with the outside world, leaving her next to no chances to study. Judging from the psychology blueprint, she should have high levels of dignity with her own goals. But her numerous defeats caused her to fall into confusion about her own position, seen from the outside as a not-so-confident T-doll who cannot become confident.

Due to numerous defects, Ribeyrolles should not have so-called friends, costing her full strength to just earn the affection from the commander. She can get some scents of [companionship] from G11, but the chances of getting hope from this is extremely bleak.

Dreamt about the day when she receives a design improvement, going to the battlefield with a normal uniform as a normal T-doll.```

Ok so let's see

HazardousJay:
mind you., this is after world war 3 fucked everyone over

HazardousJay:
so yeah, resources are bound to be hella precious

HazardousJay:
hell the HUMAN resource is so precious

nguuuquaaa:
when we have mobile laser beam and you question the cost of producing a single android? <:homeThonk:484732324198744097>

Whole Wheat cum:
There would probably be alot of major components in the torso and head

JohnTitor:
As is hospitable land

HazardousJay:
they'd rather use robots to do the job

JohnTitor:
Since like

JohnTitor:
Most of the land became inhospitable after a certain

JohnTitor:
Incident

Whole Wheat cum:
So they would need to put a thin and strong meysl

Whole Wheat cum:
I'm thinking a reinforced carbon sheet

JohnTitor:
Boobs

Whole Wheat cum:
Hmm your right

Whole Wheat cum:
Just how do they jiggle

HazardousJay:
contrary to the typical "skimpy clothing girl doesnt get hurt much"

HazardousJay:
t-dolls are pretty "fragile"

HazardousJay:
in a sense

JohnTitor:
Ya

Whole Wheat cum:
So the material I'm thinking about should be flexible

HazardousJay:
especially when a certain guy pulled a Fallout:New Vegas benny on a beloved AR team girl

Whole Wheat cum:
A carbon sheet would be flexible right

HazardousJay:
*ring a ding ding*

KAGAWALIFE:
hayo

HazardousJay:
üí• üî´

JohnTitor:
But do you have spurs

JohnTitor:
That jingle jangle

JohnTitor:
<:RibDiedInside:414195386199179265>

HazardousJay:
<:YES:427808453868781568>

JohnTitor:
<:umpOwO:500681384226979840>

Whole Wheat cum:
I'm thinking about a cost of around 900k to 1.4 mill

Whole Wheat cum:
Per doll

JohnTitor:
What currency

HazardousJay:
dollars most likely

Whole Wheat cum:
Usd

Mike Serene Hero X:
I want to grab a Tdoll's boob, *for science*.

JohnTitor:
Done

JohnTitor:


Whole Wheat cum:
OOF

HazardousJay:
but with the advances in technology in the GFL timeline

Whole Wheat cum:
Don't grab a girl's tit during work

HazardousJay:
you could trim that down to probably...

HazardousJay:
100K+ dollars per doll

HazardousJay:
give or take

Whole Wheat cum:
Well I'm pretty sure by that time material would be scarce

Whole Wheat cum:
And they probably used a bit of gold in those dolls

Mike Serene Hero X:
But grabbing a Tdoll's boob is *work*, you gotta stealthily touch the Tdoll's boob and run 100 miles to not get shot.

JohnTitor:
Unless they're like

JohnTitor:
Say

JohnTitor:
DSR

HazardousJay:
pray you dont get shot within the first 5 meters of trying to run away

Whole Wheat cum:
Dsr?

JohnTitor:
Ya

HazardousJay:
thot girl

JohnTitor:
DSR

Whole Wheat cum:
Stop using these terms REEE

HazardousJay:
thats the name of the gun

HazardousJay:
.....

HazardousJay:
DSR-50

Whole Wheat cum:
Oh

JohnTitor:
I don't know her full name

Draconex:
Lul

HazardousJay:
a fuckin' anti-materiel rifle

Draconex:
<:mk48LUL:500681251733110785>

JohnTitor:
DSR is easier to remember

Draconex:
Pew pew

HazardousJay:
KRAUT anti-materiel rifle

Draconex:
<:M4A1depression:410654965892382721>

HazardousJay:
üá©üá™

Whole Wheat cum:
<@307921946945781761> THAT SHOULD BE ABLE TO ONE HIT THESE FUCKING DOLLS

Draconex:
I have no will to do anything after my fgo gacha roll yesterday

HazardousJay:
funnily enough

HazardousJay:
she can one shot a boss

Whole Wheat cum:
...

HazardousJay:
when given enough buffs

Whole Wheat cum:
Oh

Mike Serene Hero X:
You know, you can run away after touching an SMG tdoll's bob since they'll probably miss anyway

Draconex:
Gotta balance thy game

JohnTitor:
Reminder that IWS 2000 isn't a rifle

JohnTitor:
She's actually a cannon

Whole Wheat cum:
They should add a thatos .50 cal

HazardousJay:
its a 20mm anti-materiel rifle

JohnTitor:
Rifle

JohnTitor:
Means that the barrel is rifled

JohnTitor:
Does it not?

HazardousJay:
actually yeah, its a considered a cannon at that point hahahaha

ThatDrunkRussian:
I am so

ThatDrunkRussian:
fucking sick

HazardousJay:
but rifle doesnt literally mean even the barrel, just a term i guess

Mike Serene Hero X:
You guys need to ask more important question: is FNC an B cup or a C cup?

ThatDrunkRussian:
of running these four shitty maps 10 times

ThatDrunkRussian:
every

HazardousJay:
if you put it that way

Shiki:
we were the one who got to them first

Whole Wheat cum:
Well tanks don't use fucking rockets

Shiki:
and kryuger is interested in us

Shiki:
all the "test"

HazardousJay:
i know that

JohnTitor:
Why does the girl who works on the T-Dolls have like...fox ears

JohnTitor:
<:RibDiedInside:414195386199179265>

Mike Serene Hero X:
It's just hair

Whole Wheat cum:
You mean the pdw?

JohnTitor:
No uh

Mike Serene Hero X:
Persica

nguuuquaaa:
Persica?

JohnTitor:
What's her name

JohnTitor:
Ya

Shiki:

Shiki:

Shiki:

JohnTitor:
I almost posted a spoiler

Mike Serene Hero X:
You too can have fox-ear-like hair in the *future*

Whole Wheat cum:
Ok in the future woundlt shit with the ability thr express emotions and shit like that be hella expensive

Draconex:
<:M4A1depression:410654965892382721>

JohnTitor:
She's an expensive asset

HazardousJay:
apparently, the outbreak of world war 3 made those technologies hella affordable

HazardousJay:
<:mk48LUL:500681251733110785>

Shiki:
humanity is fucked

Whole Wheat cum:
<@192425329661444097> aloy of girls have expensive assests

Shiki:
time to mess up population

Shiki:

Haru_Ria:
New dorm <:BlobReach:414069175934386177>

Whole Wheat cum:
Wtf

Shiki:
thats a storage

Whole Wheat cum:
It looks like a fever dream I had

JohnTitor:
She's the reason our T-Dolls are the way they are

JohnTitor:
And not like the SF Dolls

Mike Serene Hero X:
War, war never changes

HazardousJay:
***THEY ARE JUST MACHINES***

Shiki:
machines my ass

Whole Wheat cum:
QUESTION IS

Shiki:
they ate all my sweets

Mike Serene Hero X:
Machines with an ass

Haru_Ria:
Thers plenty of room to move though

Whole Wheat cum:
IF THERE MAFE OF FUCKING METWL SHOULDN'T WE OF USED AP ROUNDS FROM THE FUCKING START

HazardousJay:
someone stole my donuts. AND NOW SOMEONE'S GONNA PAY

Shiki:
***in the distance future***

Shiki:
"we are going to make a PMC"

Shiki:
"great idea sir"

Whole Wheat cum:
Also wouldn't the Androids easily be destroyed sense of the thin metal

HazardousJay:
"with chick robots"

Shiki:
"we gonna have the cutting edge technology of android at our disposal"

Shiki:
"great thinking sir"

Whole Wheat cum:
I mean the Androids arnt made of nuclear pasta

Shiki:
"they are all cute young girls"

Shiki:
"okay ... sir?"

Shiki:
"and we are going to provide them to our remote bases via lottery"

Whole Wheat cum:
Y'all know what nuclear pasta is?

Shiki:
"wait sir this isnt very efficin..."

Shiki:
"AND WE DONT PAY THEM AND THEY HAVE TO EARN THEIR RESOURCE"

JohnTitor:
Remember

JohnTitor:
You fund the entire PMC outta your own wallet

JohnTitor:
<:RibDiedInside:414195386199179265>

Whole Wheat cum:
John ya ever heard of nuclear pasta

JohnTitor:
No

JohnTitor:
Is it like normal pasta?

Whole Wheat cum:
Apparently it's ment to be a material 10000x stronger then steel

HazardousJay:
is it some kind of processed yellow cake

HazardousJay:
oh.

Whole Wheat cum:
But it's found on either black holes or neutron stars

JohnTitor:
Why the fuck

HazardousJay:
.... lol

JohnTitor:
Is it called Nuclear Pasta

Whole Wheat cum:
Idk

HazardousJay:
smh then its useless if you cant even extract it

Whole Wheat cum:
Anyways back to the topic of the Android's

Shiki:
i heard someone said you earn your upkeep by lending your dolls to various advertising agency and services

Whole Wheat cum:
First off the inventory is a lolicon

Whole Wheat cum:
Inventor*

Shiki:
hence all the dorms look like photoshoot studio and fancy costumes

HazardousJay:
theres a reason why they sent a loli chinese t-doll in chapter 5N

Whole Wheat cum:
Secondly let's talk about the cost of a Android

Shiki:
you are selling your dolls out for money <:SOPMODfunnyfeic:427804752701554719> shikikan is producer san

HazardousJay:
its for PR purposes

HazardousJay:
entices costumers to use your services more

HazardousJay:
and some PR bullshit

JohnTitor:
Are all the T-Dolls like

Whole Wheat cum:
So how much do you think a t-doll cost to manufacture

Mike Serene Hero X:
Whenever a stranger asks what GFL is about, I just say "You use robots that look like girls to fight other robot girls"

JohnTitor:
Converted sex dolls

JohnTitor:
Or something

Whole Wheat cum:
Oof

HazardousJay:
most likely some

totlmstr:
/me whacks <@192425329661444097>

HazardousJay:
some worked an honest job

HazardousJay:
like bakery's and what not

Whole Wheat cum:
Baka how much you think a doll cost

HazardousJay:
law enforcement

HazardousJay:
etc

JohnTitor:
What do you whack me with <@180943825206902784>

Shiki:
all of you go to jail now

JohnTitor:
SV-chan's is nice too

JohnTitor:
<:pp90blush:425688701633298434>

JohnTitor:
No no Maya

JohnTitor:
SVD is your favorite Ruskie gun

JohnTitor:
<:SOPMODfunnyfeic:427804752701554719>

HazardousJay:
lewd the SVD?

HazardousJay:
<:YES:427808453868781568>

HazardousJay:
and i guess SV-98 too

HazardousJay:
<:ump40Ehe:414074434035515392>

JohnTitor:
SVD is my favorite Russian Gun

JohnTitor:
But SV-98's art is tempting

JohnTitor:
<:M4A1depression:410654965892382721>

HazardousJay:
i mean.... who wouldnt ~~tap~~ pat that

JohnTitor:
Ikr

JohnTitor:
Tanktops? (I think that's what they're called)

JohnTitor:
They're the death of me

LoneWalker:
since everyone was talking about amazing crossovers recently

LoneWalker:
i think i have one that would be cool as well

LoneWalker:
CWCville x GFL crossover

HazardousJay:
what is a CWCville

HazardousJay:
wait..

HazardousJay:
OK NVM

LoneWalker:
pretty cool am i right ',;^)

HazardousJay:
......

HazardousJay:
<:NOPE:500694246429556757>

Mike Serene Hero X:
I like how Zas's artist likes JoJo, that explains Zas's design for me

HazardousJay:
*serbian girl doing jojo pose*

HazardousJay:


Whole Wheat cum:
Oof

Mike Serene Hero X:
*and she likes sniffing nail polish*

Whole Wheat cum:
...

HazardousJay:
üëÄ

Whole Wheat cum:
Is she retarded?

JohnTitor:
I don't thunk I've seen Zas

Mike Serene Hero X:
Short blue haired AR Tdoll

Whole Wheat cum:
Just post a picture

JohnTitor:
The girl with the uh

JohnTitor:
High Collar thing

HazardousJay:


HazardousJay:
üá∑üá∏

JohnTitor:
Oh that girl

Whole Wheat cum:
Damn it

Whole Wheat cum:
I just downloaded the picture

Whole Wheat cum:
Terrible timing

Mike Serene Hero X:
Was goin to post a screenshot too

Mike Serene Hero X:
Oh well

Whole Wheat cum:
Question

Whole Wheat cum:
Why girls

Mike Serene Hero X:
What do ya mean

Whole Wheat cum:
Is the fucking military ran by femenist in that world

HazardousJay:
the military still exists

HazardousJay:
with bad-ass robots

HazardousJay:
and bad-ass men

Whole Wheat cum:
I don't see it in the game

HazardousJay:
you will

HazardousJay:
in due time

Whole Wheat cum:
Anyways

Strela:
üîú

Whole Wheat cum:
Why the fuck is there no vechiles

Whole Wheat cum:
I'm pretty sure a good shot from a m1 Abrams could take out a t-doll

Mike Serene Hero X:
Most androids in that universe were requested as female bots, and it was more cost effective to use the mass produced female androids as tactical foot soldiers

HazardousJay:
funnily enough, the military tanks easily fuck up t-dollsl ol

Mike Serene Hero X:
From what little I know

HazardousJay:
freakin LAZER BEAMS

Whole Wheat cum:
So why aren't they using tanks then?

HazardousJay:
smol PMC thats why

HazardousJay:
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

Mike Serene Hero X:
Because tanks aren't cute

HazardousJay:
maybe in the future

nguuuquaaa:
guerilla tactics

nguuuquaaa:
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

Strela:
We are playing as PMC, not the military

Strela:
We'll see tanks later tho

Whole Wheat cum:
What dah hell is pmc

HazardousJay:
there's already a TOW Squad and some GMG team and a mortar team, so yeah

HazardousJay:
Private Military Company

Mike Serene Hero X:
Private military contractor

Strela:
Mercenary team

HazardousJay:
ya know.. like blackwater

Whole Wheat cum:
So then they should still have access to tanks

HazardousJay:
gameplay reasons

HazardousJay:
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

Strela:
I don't think typical pmc has tank <:thonk9:410657576892497930>

Whole Wheat cum:
If your talking bout the same black water I know

HazardousJay:
they do have APC's and vehicles

Strela:
We are not Koko Hekmatyar

HazardousJay:
and some tanks im sure

Whole Wheat cum:
Then they should at the very least have tanks

Mike Serene Hero X:
Our missions are mainly rescue, covert ops, and infiltration. Doubt they'd need tanks for that

HazardousJay:
of course, this is different timeline

Whole Wheat cum:
Cause the black water I know has nuclear war heads

HazardousJay:
and obviously gameplay mechanics dont allow that lol

Strela:
Besides we are newb commanders

Strela:
Lorewise

Whole Wheat cum:
Also wouldn't tanks be more cost effective

nguuuquaaa:
still not sure why newb commander is in charge of AR team tho

Whole Wheat cum:
Sense a Android is a really complex thing

HazardousJay:
depends on what you belive in cost effective

HazardousJay:
foot soldiers with a rocket launchers are hella cost-effective than tanks

GaigeDaMech:
Short hair and tomboys are gud shit.

HazardousJay:
<:YES:427808453868781568>

GaigeDaMech:

GaigeDaMech:

HazardousJay:
But what if they just do the tomboy look but are very feminine? <:thonk9:410657576892497930>

GaigeDaMech:
She's too *stoned* to decide

HazardousJay:
*badum tss*

HazardousJay:
ü•Å <:SOPMODfunnyfeic:427804752701554719>

HazardousJay:
i mean, theres B.A.R, and they classed her as a MG, so yeah. most likely Stoner 63 will be MG

Pacbough:
FG-42 is mg too

JohnTitor:
Going through the damaged sprites

JohnTitor:
Kinda fun

JohnTitor:
<:RibBleeding:415391866822066176>

HazardousJay:
no bulli

Disco Biscuits:
FG 42 and M1918 as MGs makes sense since they were designed by doctrine to act in the infantry support role

HazardousJay:
yeah

Disco Biscuits:
The BAR did start as a sort of assault rifle with the whole walking fire thing but that didn't last long

JohnTitor:
Omfg

JohnTitor:
I just realized that M1911 wears a stars and stripes bra

it's only inaccurate if you take weaboo to mean what it used to mean before everyone started to throw the term around for everything

you have to cap the heli right under elphelt tile

Jazaia Taizago:
They are at Logistics. And they're very weak and not fit for this stage.

Jazaia Taizago:
I did say i only had...like...two Echelons mainly focused on doing the majority of stuff.

suguri:
it doesn't sound like you have the quick repairs to be able to go through that method though

Jazaia Taizago:
Rest is go-getters.

Jazaia Taizago:
Well. Manpower is getting rather close to abysmal. Buuuut....

Jazaia Taizago:
Hmm.

Jazaia Taizago:
Lemme check.

suguri:
do you have chapter 0 unlocked

Jazaia Taizago:
No. I said i had Chapter 4 just unlocked.

not having ammo and looking away on something easy only to look back a minute later with half your people dying is the worst

Jazaia Taizago:
"Jaz enters. Sees the nuke appears as soon as the battle loads up. And thinks to Jazself...<:welrodWhat:500693278484725772> "

Jazaia Taizago:
My luck just hit rock bottom.

Jazaia Taizago:
Reason i didn't do X. Is i thought i had the time enough to crack her drop dead just before she'd launch another nuke on me. Apparently, as it stands, she ignores cooldown timers within battles only. And is considered a globally cooldown. If you understand my point of that...?

GaigeDaMech:
The way I see it, you could use a more RF/HG-oriented team to do this job.

Jazaia Taizago:
I don't have the resources or the time to do that right now. And i'm really not that far into the game.

GaigeDaMech:
Ah, I see

Jazaia Taizago:
I'm making do with what i've got, and taking things extremely gung-ho.

GaigeDaMech:
Well, whatever works.

GaigeDaMech:
Just tryna bring up an ideal scenario for this, is all

Jazaia Taizago:
-shrugs- I managed to get her. Ok...so...i just realized something. She launched TWO nukes in succession.

Jazaia Taizago:
That's a tad bit too far dragging a boss fight.

GaigeDaMech:
Yeah, it's why it's best to go all damage control with your T-Dolls

Chiaki:
she launches a nuke at 50% and another at 25%

Jazaia Taizago:
Ah. So she launched another one during 25% and another one during her cooldown period.

c3:
<@!182627054892613632>

Jazaia Taizago:
Hmm...maybe if i worked my way to get some replacements and levels up on other T-Dolls.

c3:
you're welcome

Jazaia Taizago:
I didn't get a Seithr from this...? Huh?

Jazaia Taizago:
Oh. S Rank probably. Ah, forgot.

Jazaia Taizago:
Whatcu think? M14 Crit or ACC?

PotatoTheFirst:
rf don't need acc

This is my main team, I made it to the boss of the last event stage and got rekt. Do they need to be more powerful, or do I have bad synergy?

Mega252:
<@474005183714689045> squad looks fine

Mega252:
Sten is pretty meh so replacing her would help

Mega252:
Otherwise you should be alright

Eluchel:
I have heard that I should have an evasion smg in the front middle. What qualifies an smg as an evasion smg?

Mega252:
High evasion

Eluchel:
Lol, makes sense

Mega252:
But the preferred smgs to have as your mt are either ump (9 or 45) type79 g36c  RO

Mega252:
If you need a cheaper core option then ingram is great

Eluchel:
Ok, i have ump 9 in my second formation. I will switch her over and put my Ingram in my second formation. Thanks!

Mega252:
Np

Mega252:
Also a great reccomendation

Mega252:
Work on your equipment

Mega252:
You seem to be lacking a lot of equipment so working on improving that will help you even more

Eluchel:
Ok, i will do that

Eluchel:
Thank you for your help :)

Jazaia Taizago:
Put my Echelon in a X formation and about to face Elphelt. Uh...wise me luck? Any other tips?

c3:
if a unit gets targeted, retreat it

Jazaia Taizago:
Ok. Got it. I pray she's not aiming for my dear M14. She's the big hitter in my gang.

SoggyCarrots:
you uh

SoggyCarrots:
dont put your formation in an x

SoggyCarrots:
until you're actually in the battle

Chiaki:
you can

SoggyCarrots:
otherwise you lose your tile buffs

Chiaki:
i don't think m14 is fast enough but if she was you could just move out of the danger zone too

Jazaia Taizago:
I...can't retreat while in pause mode. Well. Shite. Targeted my main tank, UMP45 just as i paused now.

Jazaia Taizago:
UMP sister is down.

SoggyCarrots:
you have a giant windup after targeting before she actually fires

SoggyCarrots:
just retreat them between when you see the markers and when the skill pops and you're gucci

Jazaia Taizago:
Do i literally just have her retreat or reposition instead?

Chiaki:
retreating is easier

c3:
literally retreat, no discussion

Jazaia Taizago:
Got it.

Jazaia Taizago:
Tankless squad. She's at half HP.

Jazaia Taizago:
Elphelt, that is.

Jazaia Taizago:
...

Jazaia Taizago:
That didn't work.

Jazaia Taizago:
She still hit my M14 and SOPMOD in the X formation. UMP45 was at front bottom.

suguri:
her targeting is random

Jazaia Taizago:
No. She targeted UMP45's position. I saw the marker.

Jazaia Taizago:
I hit withdraw/retreat button as suggested.

Jazaia Taizago:
Still hit two of my other squadmates.

Chuyi:
If you retreat too early

suguri:
because her targeting is 5 tiles

Chuyi:
elphelt will hit as it's retreating

Chuyi:
and hit others in the x

suguri:
being in X formation means she will never target more than 1 doll at a time

Jazaia Taizago:
M14 and SOPMOD was outside the range.

suguri:
since she always picks a doll for the center target

Jazaia Taizago:
SOPMOD was in middle middle. M14 was at bottom back.

Chuyi:
Yes, but if you retreat before she fires she can hit the doll as it's retreating.

Jazaia Taizago:
UMP45 was at front bottom.

Jazaia Taizago:
...what? Really? That's...

Jazaia Taizago:
Unfair.

Chuyi:
Thereby hitting two other dolls as well.

The Laughing Man:
Wait what

Jazaia Taizago:
<:suomiNANI:414084644322017280>

suguri:
no that doesn't happen

Aly:
<:RibDiedInside:414195386199179265> <a:agooglewine:412748960390840320>

suguri:
once she places her target it'll hit the tiles that are lit up

The Laughing Man:
If Elphelt fires her nuke as your doll is retreating that doll can still get hit?

Jazaia Taizago:
I retreated as suggest during her "Giant windup".

c3:
never happened to me at least

Jazaia Taizago:
I'll try this again. And repair all my girls for a second attempt. Should i fail again, then well...i'll show you just what happened.

Chiaki:
not the doll that's retreating, but the doll that gets caught in the tile, what can happen is a movement shift because you lose your max range and your backline is forced to go forward, so the tiles are pushed forward too

suguri:
that's why you have an x formation

suguri:
it fixes your attack range

The Laughing Man:
whim you so smart

suguri:
retreating 1 doll from the front won't make your squad move

Chiaki:
yeah, but if you retreat them both... ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

Chuyi:
Unless you lose your entire front column.

Jazaia Taizago:
I did.

Jazaia Taizago:
I had the two UMPs tanking front. She took down the first sister and was about to nuke the second.

Jazaia Taizago:
I did as instructed. Is all that i'm saying! -shrugs-

suguri:
blame it on the misfortune of your birth

Jazaia Taizago:
<:roCry:414084703323160576>

suguri:
I'm actually surprised it took 8 days for that unfortunate programming fault to actually affect somebody

Jazaia Taizago:
I could attempt my second squad. But no one will guarding HQ then. And this map is STUUUUPID long one way only ticket.

suguri:
there's a way to brute force your way through

Chuyi:
You can deploy a third echelon.

suguri:
right now just clear your dailies of E1-E3

Jazaia Taizago:
Lifes hard when you're grinding resources for duplicates and only getting nonsense.

suguri:
and level your dolls in 4-3e

commie:
you shouldn't hope for dupes

Jazaia Taizago:
I should hope for dupes. It's the only hope i have, other then throw my wallet at the game and see if that helps.

suguri:
you have 2 weeks and you are aiming to be able to kill elphelt 6 times on the last day

commie:
doing maps for cores is more important to link your dolls, especially if they are important ones you need to progress

commie:
even if they're 3 times the cost of what their rarity gives you

commie:
if you need to spend 6 cores to link that M14, do it

suguri:
how many chapters have you unlocked

Jazaia Taizago:
M14 has served me well beyond my expectations. So i would use Cores on her, yeah.

Jazaia Taizago:
Just about chapter....uh...four?

Jazaia Taizago:
Yeah.

Jazaia Taizago:
I just today managed to finish the Night Mission on Chapter 1 to get Equipment Enhancement.

suguri:
you should try to unlock new chapters to open more efficient logistics

suguri:
abuse friend echelons if you need to

Jazaia Taizago:
I also have spare coin to use on the game. SHOULD i manage to get the Event Characters.

Jazaia Taizago:
I do after all have Aku. Heh.

Jazaia Taizago:
A good list of friends to use. Thank you, people on my friends list!

suguri:
I know some of these names

suguri:
<:homeThonk:484732324198744097>

commie:
they're from that cult :V

Jazaia Taizago:
Eh. Aku's nice enough to me.

commie:
the one that does uh lucc succing rituals

suguri:
drop me your uid

Jazaia Taizago:
I think it's unfair i don't get to use Friends on this Event, though. They knew we'd take advantage of that. Grr!

Jazaia Taizago:
Oh. Uh, sec.

Rose ‚ôß:
mhm

Jazaia Taizago:
<a:ablobowo:412748548174774272> Nothing to see here. Nobody put anything in a wrong place!

Rose ‚ôß:
I think it's better if we weren't allowed to use our friend echelons to cheese events

skaianDestiny:
Events dont let you use friends

c3:
would be a bit less of an event then

skaianDestiny:
Only your own hard won echelons

c3:
yup

skaianDestiny:
So keep that in mind for Artic Warfare

c3:
makes it more.. involving?

commie:
I think that's what he wanted to say, he just wrong grammar'd

suguri:
didn't catch it

suguri:

ah yes the game that shall not be mentioned in gf-mainroom

Jazaia Taizago:
Ok then.

commie:
is just jok

commie:
no need to delete the entire message :V

Jazaia Taizago:
...but...nobody was taking that well. So...?

c3:
it's kinda our competitor, even though some here play both

skaianDestiny:
what game

c3:
azure lolis

commie:
az- banned from gf-mainroom

suguri:
idk what else you deleted but you could've kept the uid up

Jazaia Taizago:
I honestly don't care for competition when i like both. I've seen a lot of mobile games. And a majority most of them aren't that.....good. Despite my wishes they would be. I enjoy GF and AL equally.

Jazaia Taizago:
The UID is in GF-ID.

Jazaia Taizago:
I'm just following protocol rules.

commie:
as a note, if you want people to notice things on other channels, you should tag them

Kfish:

suguri:
uid channel is just a place where you can go to add someone or indicate that you're available to be added

Jazaia Taizago:
Mmkay. Normally, the rules indicate to put certain discussion, topics and content available on certain channels at a time. That's just from me having done previous strict rulesets when it came to a Community.

Jazaia Taizago:
Thought that's my experience years ago. I suppose it's very different here and perhaps other places too that i'm unaware of.

AlliedG üá¨üáß:

two people conducting a uid exchange isn't the same as turning mainroom into an addfest

commie:
fal's worth it

commie:
pretty good AR for her skill, and she'll have some utility later on

suguri:
the gem card montly counts for fal if that's what he's asking

commie:
huh, I thought he was asking if it had a first purchase bonus

commie:
my bad I guess

suguri:
the card itself is considered a 300 gem package

suguri:
it just gives you 900 instead over the period of 30 days

Jazaia Taizago:
Uh. So...is there a easy way to beat the last stage of the Event going on? I managed to get to Elphelt. But her ultimate wrecked me beyond recovery.

suguri:
delta split

commie:
are you following the guide on elphelt?

commie:
placing your echelon in X formation and all that

skaianDestiny:
put your echelon in an X formation

Jazaia Taizago:
I have no idea about gides.

skaianDestiny:
retreat the targeted T-doll

suguri:
you should have a squad of at least 70x4 dolls before attempting her

c3:
there's a help section just below this one, you should browse it

Jazaia Taizago:
I have 50s. Max norm affinity, at least decent geared.

Jazaia Taizago:
Lemme just throw a picture in. Sec.

commie:
50s might be tough

suguri:
jus do the first 3 maps daily for 8 seithr

suguri:
then level yourself in 4-3e

Jazaia Taizago:
Not really. I managed just fine using guerilla strategy against the mobs.

commie:
if anything just because level 50 ARs will have a tough time against elphelt's armor

commie:
well yeah, the event stage mobs are significantly weaker than elphelt

Jazaia Taizago:
I got to her with full HP and supplies. Repairing on field.

suguri:
elphelt is on a different level from the mobs you had to face

Milky Moo:
quick update for anyone who cares about my problem with nox

Milky Moo:
i set the cores to the max cores on my cpu

Milky Moo:
and that fixed it

commie:
I thought I'd need a second echelon for non-boss killing duties and but I am just levelling 3x dolls on the mobs

commie:
they're that weak

Milky Moo:
yeah the mobs leading to elphelt are stupid easy

Milky Moo:
but elphelt just destroys

Milky Moo:
and that's not fun

suguri:
the only things that pose a problem are the mg mobs

Jazaia Taizago:
They truly are. They can make small dents in me, but that's basically it.

Jazaia Taizago:
The artilleries are a bit scary. They like to punch my SOPMOD.

Jazaia Taizago:
Not very impressive, i assume? Been away for a while. Had to be busy mostly for reasons.

Milky Moo:
oh you guys are low CE

Milky Moo:
that's explains a bit

Milky Moo:
m14 isn't getting any buffs but that's probably fine

suguri:
he said his gorls were in their 50s

Jazaia Taizago:
M14 still effs up anyone who understimates her.

Milky Moo:
sorry i didn't scroll up haha

Milky Moo:
mb mb

suguri:
what skill levels

commie:
hm, those are roughly the levels of my echelon that's on E4 to farm

commie:
but that is really tough if you want to go for elphelt

commie:
you should spend some time on exp maps instead

suguri:
for starters, elphelt is subtracting a flat 50 damage from everybody on that team

commie:
as long as you kill elphelt 6 times, even if it's on the last day, you'll get her

suguri:
except m14

Jazaia Taizago:
10 on SOPMOD. 10 on G41. 10 on UMP45. 10 on M14 and 5 on UMP9.

suguri:
10 on the umps are a bit useless here but it's fine

suguri:
you really just need levels and access to gold gear

commie:
that's fine, flashbangs don't do anything to bosses

Jazaia Taizago:
I wasn't offline from GF. I just let idle levelling and stuff occur and put them to work otherwise while i was busy.

commie:
it's the stats on your dolls that are low, go farm 4-3E for a while

c3:
üôè

commie:
like clockwork

c3:
<:RibDiedInside:414195386199179265>

Jazaia Taizago:
The Flashbang sorta works. Just not effectively against bosses. But anything not a boss.

Jazaia Taizago:
I have the sisters there for Tank-Trading when one gets too hurt.

commie:
yeah what I mean is that it doesn't do anything to elphelt

Jazaia Taizago:
I managed to get Shorty. Buuuut....she's way underlevelled.

commie:
so it doesn't matter if your UMP9 is at SL1 or 10

commie:
she's not going to help you much, your best bet is to level your ARSMG to 70 4x

suguri:
what other rfs do you have

commie:
follow a guide on how to move your echelon for elphelt's special move and it should be simple enough

Jazaia Taizago:
Sorry. Just putting on equipment factory farming. To upgrade stuff.

Jazaia Taizago:
Just gonna check my RFs for a sec.

Jazaia Taizago:


suguri:
so things look bleak on that front

Jazaia Taizago:
Yeah. I managed to farm enough points to get JN.

suguri:
how about your core stash

Jazaia Taizago:
28 cores.

suguri:
<a:ablobsweats:412748432944529410>

pai:
grrr, the keychains I wanted to buy are sold out... Hope they restock soon

suguri:
so let's make killing elphelt a long term goal

Chripper:
<:thonk9:410657576892497930>

pai:
Now the question is, spend keychain money on gems?

skaianDestiny:
because the tanks got too damaged

Rose ‚ôß:
what skaian said ^

Thyferra:
so getting hit by 3 burst is the problem then

Rose ‚ôß:
In short, it's your echelon doesn't take too much damage

Thyferra:
glad someone told me that

Thyferra:
last time someone told me that i can't get damaged art

Rose ‚ôß:
battle rank is determined by total hp lost to total hp of echelon

Sparkee100:
kill her before she use her special

skaianDestiny:
p much

Sparkee100:
ezClap

Rose ‚ôß:
That's one way to say it

skaianDestiny:
HGRF is the best way

Thyferra:
she is using her special twice on me

Rose ‚ôß:
Oof

Sparkee100:
WA, SVD, Lee, M14 is pog

Sparkee100:
use them

Thyferra:
and i got s 14 out of 21 times i think

Sparkee100:
do u have rifle handgun squad?

Thyferra:
yeah but lee is not leveled yet

Sparkee100:
well u just need 2 rifles

Sparkee100:
2 rifle 3 hg

Sparkee100:
the standard RFHG squad

Thyferra:
well i got more than 3 days to get to 100 seithrs

Sparkee100:
ye

Thyferra:
so i am just fine skipping the last boss

Thyferra:
i am at 78 now and still no noel

commie:
ganbatte, m8

commie:
and do it for elphelt, even if only because pulling shotguns is horrible

AlliedG üá¨üáß:

AlliedG üá¨üáß:

well, good for you, innit? perhaps it would also be trivial for us if we had exodia

AlliedG üá¨üáß:
Too lazy to beat elphelt so moan

Rose ‚ôß:
not all of us do

AlliedG üá¨üáß:
Use wa2k and svd

AlliedG üá¨üáß:
Or NTW

AlliedG üá¨üáß:
There are many rf combos

Rose ‚ôß:
Let him say what he wants

AlliedG üá¨üáß:
You can use all mg for s rank even

Rose ‚ôß:
lack of sympathy is another issue

Thyferra:
well at least now i understand why i get a ranks sometimes and no s.

AlliedG üá¨üáß:
It's all hp loss

Thyferra:
<@165656234941218816> thx for explaining that to me

AlliedG üá¨üáß:
If you  have only one heavily dmg

AlliedG üá¨üáß:
You can still s rank

There's nothing random about it

üå∏Senkan Fus≈çüå∏:
You get hit badly, you get A rank

Thyferra:
i am not allowed to get a damaged art i know that... and when i dont and still get a rank i dont understand it anymore

skaianDestiny:
NTW's artist is regretful they didn't make NTW black (since the gun was made in South Africa)

Thyferra:
so yeah that feels just random to me

skaianDestiny:
S rank requirement is that you dont lose more than 30% of total echelon HP

skaianDestiny:
you could lose an entire gun as long as her health isn't more than 30% of the echelons hp

skaianDestiny:
so its possible to lose 3 guns and get an S rank, yet have no one die and get an A rank

Shiki:

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:

salty emp:

Shiki:

Shiki:

T√∂nshi:
If we dont condone abuse here dont condone 6P62 abuse either

Shiki:

Shiki:

Shiki:
the skill activation time is crap

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:

SleepyDuck:

SleepyDuck:

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:

Shiki:


SleepyDuck:

SleepyDuck:

SleepyDuck:

T√∂nshi:
Woah

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
she was abused by humans in the past

SleepyDuck:
Agreed, she carries blood in her body

SleepyDuck:
tbh

c3:
it's kinda implied that thunder was pretty much a sex doll, as she was designed to be particularly expressive

SleepyDuck:
probably for transfusion or some shit

salty emp:
~~i fit the criteria of an abusive commander~~

Shiki:
"The uniform she wore resembles the French forces in the Franco-Prussian War in which the French defeated and suffered 750.000 casualties aftermath."

DocPropane:
french war reenactor?

DocPropane:
i mean

DocPropane:
i do wonder who designed an android to be sick all the time

DocPropane:
and for what purpose

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
ask G11 designer

DocPropane:
same guy who designed an android who naps, I bet

DocPropane:
lmao

DocPropane:
jinxed me

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
why would you make an android that sleeps all the time

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
make zero senses

AWACS Sky Eye:
why would you make android, even

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
for

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:

SleepyDuck:

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:

DocPropane:

SleepyDuck:

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
I don't see any star

T√∂nshi:
STAR

DocPropane:

SleepyDuck:
THIS STAR

AWACS Sky Eye:
note:

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
oh that star

T√∂nshi:
No I only see AR-15

AWACS Sky Eye:
before, she was rated 5*

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
sorry I was eh....

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
distracted

T√∂nshi:
a ST AR-15

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
by eh....

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
something

AWACS Sky Eye:
like, way back the event is started in CN server

SleepyDuck:
she was 1*?

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
<:Huaji:414068953615171584>

SleepyDuck:
Fuck you mica

SleepyDuck:
<:SOPMODfunnyfeic:427804752701554719>

AWACS Sky Eye:
both Noel and Elphy was rated as 5*

SleepyDuck:
oh.....

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:

SleepyDuck:
<:NOPE:500694246429556757>

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
mica wake up

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
you are making a big mistake

Shiki:


IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
A BIG ONE

SleepyDuck:
WPW

DocPropane:
spas 12 is the ideal waifu and im gonna oath her the second she's out on EN

SleepyDuck:
SHIKI PLEASE COMMIT UNLIVE

SleepyDuck:
<:SOPMODfunnyfeic:427804752701554719>

salty emp:
NO!

Ashina:
Imagine a 0*

Shiki:
<:SOPMODfunnyfeic:427804752701554719>

AWACS Sky Eye:
but seeing that we gonna get more collab girls back then (the Honk hon collab), the event girls got their own rating

AWACS Sky Eye:
the EXTRA rating

AWACS Sky Eye:
aka 1*

DocPropane:
my only complaint about spas is that she could be squishier

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
hence the EXTRA thicc-ness?

AWACS Sky Eye:
it's basically 5* with bigger star and purple color.

salty emp:
FUCK 
YOU
CHLOE

T√∂nshi:
PPShSPP is also alright

AWACS Sky Eye:
so yeah

Shiki:
> no one look at sharkteeth shotgun

DocPropane:
like I can see that she's got a few extra cm around the waust, which is good

AWACS Sky Eye:
despite being 1*, they eat 15 cores per link.

SleepyDuck:
Man, ST AR-15 is actually decent as a dragger

Shiki:
the real THICC

DocPropane:
guns tho, that's something I can really geek out about

AWACS Sky Eye:
"Oh, they just androids with guns, no historical soul BS"

Shiki:
imo GFL story is pretty good admittedly but sometimes it falls into the "oh come on not this again"

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
right

T√∂nshi:
GFL's soundtrack is pretty good ngl

Axylum:
you gotta admit, for a gacha game, GFL has a very good story

AWACS Sky Eye:
GFL *tries* not to go with the standard of the genre.

T√∂nshi:
0-4 as stock soundtrack takes the cake

Axylum:
^^

Axylum:
Yessss

AWACS Sky Eye:
they said that the girls are androids and their guns are just what they been given/selected

salty emp:
lol

Shiki:
GFL need to throw the good soundtracks around more often

Shiki:
not just limited time events

salty emp:
i actually forgot what 0-4 sounded like

salty emp:
lemme see

T√∂nshi:
I mean, thats what made them good

Axylum:
lol

AWACS Sky Eye:
not like "G11 is the manifestation of her namesake gun"

Axylum:
yeah

Shiki:
it only kicks up very late in the story outside of event

AWACS Sky Eye:
I mean, imagining the IRL G11 as a sleepy beepo is just

AWACS Sky Eye:
*what*

Axylum:
hahaha

Shiki:
404 has some historical reference atleast

Shiki:
but thats kinda minor

salty emp:
oh i remember now

salty emp:
its the tutorial soundtrack isnt it

Axylum:
I actually don't know much about 404 outside of their squad members

AWACS Sky Eye:
though yeah, some girls do have their military references in it.

DocPropane:
"HK M4?"

Axylum:
Spas 12 art was very interesting

Axylum:
with the speed loading

T√∂nshi:
Yeah tutorial soundtrack

AWACS Sky Eye:
You can thank her artist for that, SW.

Axylum:
lol HK M4

Axylum:
I blame battlefield

T√∂nshi:
But even as a standalone track in 0-4 it's arguably pretty badass

Axylum:
for calling it the M416

DocPropane:
spas artist is a man of culture

AWACS Sky Eye:
Terras did a lot of work on their girls design.

Shiki:
i miss cube music

Axylum:
I can't wait until digimind comes

Axylum:
new looks :o

c3:
I miss djmax music :^)

salty emp:
cant wait for singularity campaign

DocPropane:
"she's stronk so she has to eat a lot, that's why she's plump" god bless you you magnificent bastard

Axylum:
hahahaha you read that too

Shiki:
and then we have g41 artist

Shiki:
<:SOPMODfunnyfeic:427804752701554719>

salty emp:
>magnificent bastard

Axylum:
LOL

salty emp:
i know a certain brit youtuber that uses that phrase a lot

Axylum:
G41 va is the same as Happy from Fairy tail o.o

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
it's kugimiya rie

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
tsundere queen

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
she's more than famous

DocPropane:
g11 is competing with fn fal for the "top fashion disaster" award

Axylum:
LOL

T√∂nshi:
Fal and the mink thats following her around

T√∂nshi:
At least G11 has her reasons

DocPropane:
who's gonna win

T√∂nshi:
FAL not so much

DocPropane:
comfy hobo

DocPropane:
or the one-sock wannabe runway queen

Axylum:
some T-dolls are based on civilian androids right?

Axylum:
I wonder what FAL was

T√∂nshi:
They are, not just based on

Axylum:
oh well, you know what I meant

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
what FAL was?

T√∂nshi:
They just are civilian androids with fire control chips

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
well

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
look at her

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
you can

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
guess

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
<:springTea:427818533431410691>

Axylum:
my friend called her a Model

Shiki:

Shiki:

SleepyDuck:
QUACK

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
and then there's thunder

SleepyDuck:
THE DUCK IS WOKETHHH

T√∂nshi:
I mean 9A-91 was what you would expect

Axylum:
I need to look at her again

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
with her suicidal tendency

T√∂nshi:
Ribeyrolles, well

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
I wonder what she was originally used for

SleepyDuck:
ü¶Ü

Shiki:
it was reference to the uh

Axylum:
who's suicidal tendancy?

SleepyDuck:
Me

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
thunder

SleepyDuck:
<:40wave:425688663939219476>

Axylum:
oh ok

T√∂nshi:
Same man

SleepyDuck:
wait what

SleepyDuck:
were you asking who had suicidal tendencies

SleepyDuck:
or about dolls that suicide

SleepyDuck:
<:thonk9:410657576892497930>

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
it's said that she was abused in the past

c3:
just have m2 sit on you. with her gun. and get it over with

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:

Ashina:
Wait, its smol

Axylum:

Shiki:
why not linking <:umpOwO:500681384226979840>

Axylum:
does anyone know the general population of EN GFL?

AWACS Sky Eye:
not sure.

AWACS Sky Eye:
best answer: alot.

Axylum:
yeah, I was questioning how popular GFL is

Axylum:
compared to Azur lane <.<

Shiki:
you can be sure al is winning

AWACS Sky Eye:
in my opinion, Azur Lane is more popular.

Shiki:
by a landslide

Axylum:
way more

Axylum:
but I still prefer GFL

DocPropane:
same here

AWACS Sky Eye:
they managed to have quite a success with their ads (fucking siigari)

Axylum:
since Azur lane doesn't exactly feel original

Shiki:
AL marketting is way better too

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
azur lane advertises a lot

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
like

Axylum:
that could be why

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
everywhere

Axylum:
I never see ads for GFL

DocPropane:
I just prefer guncolle's gameplay at least on mobile

Shiki:
remember the week where all your youtube ads were that beardy guy who yelling at a pull for animu botes

salty emp:
~~and you can download the apk in SEA, for GFL EN I don't see shite~~

AWACS Sky Eye:
and *unlike AL*, we really didn't want those 3rd party ads that goes utterly wrong.

DocPropane:
shmups just don't work for me on mobile, with my clumsy fat fingers

Axylum:
lol

DocPropane:
turn based is best

DocPropane:
also

[SB] The Yuri Guy:
I fucking hate X exos

AWACS Sky Eye:
I mean, when we got those ads with WA being held by Agent 47? we pretty much cut ties with them.

AWACS Sky Eye:
meanwhile AL? they embracing those shitty ads.

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
ah that

PotatoTheFirst:
i guess it worked for them

AWACS Sky Eye:
those one where it's just a stock photo of a hand selecting AL waifus.

Shiki:
our advertisement campaign was pretty shit not gonna lie

Shiki:
use nier automata picture too

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
tbh the reason why I don't play AL is because I don't know anything about ships

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
and

DocPropane:
also I think AL has too many lolis for my taste

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
too many ship games already

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
and yeah

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
AL only has 2 types

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
loli and banzoongas

Axylum:
Kancolle was enough for ship girls

DocPropane:
granted, the titty monsters are üëå üëå üëå üëå

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
nothing inbetween

Shiki:
not really

Shiki:
kancolle has the fanbase

Shiki:
but its not really a game

Shiki:
its like an idle webgame ( actually it is )

Shiki:
AL is more of a game

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
you mean RNG-colle

AWACS Sky Eye:
Kancolle is also a bonus for those animu lovers who is *also* into history, because their girls is like "half waifus, half historical references"

DocPropane:
kancolle has more in common with betting on horse races than with video games tbh

Axylum:
the only thing I didn't like about the kancolle game is the amount of RNG

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
unfortunately I have never been into ships

AWACS Sky Eye:
AL is "80% thot/lolis, 20% history"

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
just

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
guns

Shiki:
and yea the girls in KC all have historical reference

T√∂nshi:
GFL ads, 2020

Axylum:
ye, GFL is where its at

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
and one more important thing is

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
GFL has good story

DocPropane:
oh yes

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
what's AL's story again?

AWACS Sky Eye:
And remember, KC, AL, yada yada yada all based on *one simple theme*.

Axylum:
GFL has the best story of all gacha games I've played

Axylum:
haha, AL story is forgettable

DocPropane:
also, I aint into warships as much as I was back when I played kancolle

salty emp:
60 gold eq

AWACS Sky Eye:
that the girls are souls based from boats.

AWACS Sky Eye:
GFL?

salty emp:
dont froget the soundtrack

Axylum:
GFL is unique

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
GnK allying with SF

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
is something that should happen

Kane:
<:suomiNANI:414084644322017280>

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
rather

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
GnK keeps fighting SF

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
is a waste of time

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
and effort

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
and would only harm both side

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
<:springTea:427818533431410691>

T√∂nshi:
Then Elphelt being a ringleader walking around

salty emp:
true dat

salty emp:
~~elphelt skin is too expensive tehrefore ruled out of the equation~~

T√∂nshi:
Would you say the same if Defector M16 is thirty bucks

salty emp:
...no

T√∂nshi:
Exactly

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
I'd say SF16 being 30 bucks is

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
too expensive

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
it's just different hair color

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
and a bonus coat

Shatterstar Nova:

Shatterstar Nova:
the skin aren't in a lootbox

Sleepworking is like Sleepwalking

T√∂nshi:
You don't notice it but you fuck shit up in the end

Shatterstar Nova:
thats why you constantly refine it

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
refine the technique?

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
so that you can sleepwork and not fuck shits up?

Shatterstar Nova:
yep

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
that'd require years of training

Shatterstar Nova:
it starts with your life along

T√∂nshi:
You refine it so you still fuck shit up but it benefits you

T√∂nshi:
Then your team

Axylum:
why does the GF wiki have this path?

Axylum:
when this path is faster, takes one less turn, and only needs one echelon

Scroubignon:
By now everyone's brain should be somewhat proficient at finding the shorter paths

Shatterstar Nova:
obviously

JohnTitor:
No Booli

T√∂nshi:
The latter path is also the safest

Chaotix:

Hikimouto:
wait

Hikimouto:
sorry forgot

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
gameplay wise, negev is a bad MG

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
personality wise, negev is not a good MG

skaianDestiny:
so i just found out m1919's carmilla outfit has naked skin in the uncensored version and tbh? the censored version is sexier

Hikimouto:
but

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
stat wise, negev is a horrible MG

Hikimouto:
isnt she pretending to be a yandere? wait where was that dialogue lemme find

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
she's not pretending

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
it's just her face that's like one

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
she's a bloodthirsty berserker

skaianDestiny:
yeah shes aping the yandere trait

Hikimouto:
but wasnt it her just being awkward af and chose to take on yandere persona because people listen to her?

skaianDestiny:
and the bloodthirsty trait

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
no

skaianDestiny:
any blood you see on her is prolly just ketchup

Hikimouto:
ayyyy they lied to me

Hikimouto:

<:kalinaGem:427818502141902848>

JohnTitor:
Equipment Spam Time

Hikimouto:
when next rate up i gotta swipe for

Hikimouto:
or at least, when they *say* its gonna be but itll totally be half a year later

The Laughing Man:
There's a rate up each month

ninth:
Maybe new year

ninth:
2x rate up on Production/Equipment

The Laughing Man:
Probably around mid Dec

Hikimouto:
oo

JohnTitor:
I got another 5* AP

JohnTitor:
<:ShotMink:410655372840402945>

JohnTitor:
Give me HP and HV

ninth:
only 1 5* HP

The Laughing Man:
But if you're talking about general rate up instead of new T-doll rate up, then we have no idea cause those are rare

Hikimouto:
actually, maybe i should go for negev? i only spammed for HG so far, but i legit lack a decent MG

JohnTitor:
Same

JohnTitor:
Wait no

JohnTitor:
I have 2

JohnTitor:
And 1 HV

ninth:
People said Negev is rare

JohnTitor:
Lots of 4* AP

Hikimouto:
so last rateup i got ribey dancu and contender, but im pretending to my friend i didnt get any

Hikimouto:
so i slowly leveling them

Hikimouto:
and one day theyll catch up to first echelon and set as friend support

skaianDestiny:
negev is niche, shes meme but youd rather have the big 4

The Laughing Man:
And then once they're lvl 100 you put then on your support list?

ninth:
How many lv 100 now?

Hikimouto:
yee

Hikimouto:
i just reached 90 5x with 416 and ump9 yesterday

Hikimouto:
.___.

skaianDestiny:
i have full AR team for my day support

Rose ‚ôß:
Negev is terrible for current EN content

Hikimouto:
i legit dont have night support

Hikimouto:
or even night ech for me

JohnTitor:
I have MG5

Hikimouto:
working on it tho

skaianDestiny:
just stick some peqs on some ars and youre fine

Rose ‚ôß:
The battle needs to drag on for long enough for negev to be noticable in terms of dps

Hikimouto:
ye i mean i got to 2-1 just using my AR first ech, but it feels like ill hit a wall soon, so i was gonna work on a RF ech next

skaianDestiny:
g43s a good budget option

Hikimouto:
im leveling a war god and tsuntsun

skaianDestiny:
for night rf

Hikimouto:
god i havent gotten g43 yet

skaianDestiny:
shes a 2 star

Hikimouto:
wait

Hikimouto:
am i thinking of diff

Hikimouto:
sec

skaianDestiny:
she yells "guten tag" for intro

Hikimouto:
ooooooooooo

Hikimouto:
her

Hikimouto:
I was thinking like g36c

skaianDestiny:
she has rof skill, which is good, but for night

Hikimouto:
and was thrown off

Hikimouto:
sry lel

skaianDestiny:
so you can stick her with wa

Rose ‚ôß:
gewehr 43?

Hikimouto:
yeah the kraut 2 star

Rose ‚ôß:
she's decent for a 2*

Hikimouto:
hmm

Rose ‚ôß:
svd / wa is preferred, m14 if you are on a core budget or don't have them

skaianDestiny:
if youve already got m14 leveled at a decent number dont switch out

Hikimouto:
for a night ech, should i have 2 rf or 3 rf?

Rose ‚ôß:
2 rf

skaianDestiny:
2 is good

Hikimouto:
okay then nvm

Rose ‚ôß:
3 rf is not enough buffing and over hitting some enemies

Hikimouto:
i got tsunbulli and wargod to at least 40 ish

JohnTitor:
I might make a uh

JohnTitor:
NTW Squad

Hikimouto:

HazardousJay:

Hikimouto:

Hikimouto:

HazardousJay:
<:ump40Ehe:414074434035515392>

skaianDestiny:
a lot of people rn seem to think you can get by with just "click and watch your raifus shoot :3"

ninth:
Still you can now

HazardousJay:
Ill worry about the tactics when it comes

Hikimouto:
i only just learned to kite jaegers last week ._____.

skaianDestiny:

skaianDestiny:

skaianDestiny:

skaianDestiny:
given the army has BEAMU guns on light tanks

Hikimouto:
hecc, g11 just hit 70 but i only have 15 cores

Hikimouto:
just kill me fam

skaianDestiny:
you say its too long but most people in their current states will get absolutely wrecked in future events

ninth:
Isnt we get content at slower pace than CN relatively?

Hikimouto:
if i get rekt with elphelt in current event, then ye, future events i dont stand a chance

skaianDestiny:
no

HazardousJay:
Depends

HazardousJay:
But were gaining speed afaik

skaianDestiny:
we're gonna be getting it at a faster pace next year

HazardousJay:
Best to grind your best dolls before the hard shit comes

HazardousJay:
Call it a blessing in disguise

skaianDestiny:
you do NOT want to have the rush korea got

Hikimouto:
pls game survive 1-2 years

Hikimouto:
cuz these legit decent raifus

The Laughing Man:
Cause when shit hits the fan, you'll want us to go back to having no events just so you can grind shit out

Hikimouto:
ill actually swipe for it

skaianDestiny:
they caught up to CN in a year and they *hated* it

HazardousJay:

Eluchel:
Hey, I just unlocked my 6th formation. I have 3 logistics formations and 2 combat formations ( 1 is 2smg 3ar, and the other is 2smg, 2ar, 1rf). Should I make my 6th formation my final logistics formation, or my third combat formation (maybe my first dedicated night formation)?

august99us:
üëÖ

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
too long!!!!!!

august99us:
it should be your logibat formation

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
but it has to be done

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
to make IWS usable

Kane:
she's the bullet catcher, I prefer 9 for her flashes

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
<:roCry:414084703323160576>

Kane:
smokes are NEHH

Hikimouto:
cuz i havent read the stuff about 40 yet, so my only knowledge of 45 is how she brainwashes 9 to be her "sister", aka slave

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
you know

Kane:
üó° she what

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
smokes are

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
better than flash

Kane:
üó°

Rose ‚ôß:
^

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
gameplay wise

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
it's far better

Hikimouto:
45 a shiiiiit

Hikimouto:

Hikimouto:

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
45's buff tile and tile buff are also

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
one of a kind

Rose ‚ôß:

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
of some people here

Draconex:
Aug keeps changing his name

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
really

Kane:
understandable

Hecate:
So how do I suppose rearrange this team?

Hikimouto:
as long as you know

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
RFs ignore shields

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
but not scouts

nguuuquaaa:
I always do 101~109 with HGRF

Kane:
ITS 45

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
for some god knows why reason

nguuuquaaa:
and RFs always clear jaegers first for me

Hikimouto:
naisuuu~

Kane:
AHAHAHAHAHAHAHA

Kane:
*finally some good fucking food*

Hikimouto:
rename to Hdoesntgiveafuckabouthersister45 when?

Kane:
well when UMP( AND 416 will be in the echelon..

Kane:
*9

nguuuquaaa:
I mean RFs target backline so targeting scouts instead of jaegers doesn't make sense

Hikimouto:
my man

Hecate:
Now that I somehow cleared 91-100 wave some time ago, I cant test this team's effectiveness on night battle

Hikimouto:
im workin on that too

Hikimouto:
should i try to get first echelon to 5x so i can s rank bunny, or should i just work on my second getting it to 4x so it doesnt get rekt defending command post?

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
why not both

Hikimouto:
cuz

Hikimouto:
lazy

Hikimouto:
i try my best to be sleepo beepo, and be too lazy to do hard work unless forced

Kane:
SOPPO and M4 are surrounded by 404 lmao

Kane:
love it

august99us:
reeeee where's my g11 :beer16:

Kane:

Rose ‚ôß:

Kane:

Rose ‚ôß:
45

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
*look at lvl 100 SL10 G11*

Hikimouto:
45 for meta, 9 for love

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
<:minkLove:427816604659613707>

Kane:
45 for maintank, 9 for offtank then. Perfect

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
that's my main team

Hikimouto:
i got 9 to 5x yesterday, first 5x ever

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
AR 15   ump9
M4A1   ump45
homete

Kane:
I have SOPPO M$ and 416 b ehind the UMP gals so

Kane:
M4*

Kane:
I was just super hype to see 2:15 I had to use a quick build

Kane:

Hikimouto:

Hikimouto:

C4Cypher:

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:

Kane:
416    UMP45 (to train her up)
M4    UMP9
Soppo

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
I think you should switch

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
416 and soppu

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
soppu increases eva for both

Kane:
Ive thought abt it

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
416 benefits none of the 2

Hikimouto:
someone said soppu https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/516437075180912650/516501434246889472/15432107435481.png

Kane:
Soppu is good doggo

Tom Brady:
<:SOPwao:465878170046955521>

Hikimouto:
best AR

Hikimouto:
fite me

Hikimouto:
shittykans

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
416's tile buff doesn't benefit any of the umps

Kane:
this also means now that I have .45 I can retire Sten Mk2 from the mainline to replace PP-2000 in the second line

Tom Brady:
You need a dps AR

Tom Brady:
dble naders

Tom Brady:
isn't the best matchup

Tom Brady:
wait

Kane:
hmm...

Tom Brady:
thats 0-2

Tom Brady:
isn't it

Hikimouto:
its not about meta, its about rabu

Kane:
raifu is love

Kane:
raifu is life

Hikimouto:
raifu is rabu

Kane:

<:axecution:414068938083794944>

C4Cypher:
Does levelling a doll improve their stats at all, or does it just raise the enhancement stat caps?

Draconex:
I didnt post that so idk

Shiki:
they only raise the stat cap

suguri:
leveling increases hp

Draconex:
<:hkStare2:414084643848192006>

suguri:
and armor

Shiki:
unless you count linking

Draconex:
Some skill multipliers increase with linking

suguri:
bamboos are per link

C4Cypher:
Noted, but if you want to actually improve dam, acc, crit or eva you need to enhance.  Thanks.

suguri:
grenades are single except for one specific very new ar

C4Cypher:
FAL for the win

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
not FAL tho

C4Cypher:
FAL eats crowds for breakfast

suguri:
fal still only fires from a single link

suguri:
just 3 times

suguri:
k11 fires from each link

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
also her nades don't do that much damage

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
so she doesn't really eat crowds

suguri:
for a total of 28x potential damage on a single target

suguri:
<:OK:500692128058572800>

Shiki:
fal stat is meh outside of the nade

Ruzike:
I just seen a tdoll in an azur lane ad

Shiki:
sop is best

suguri:
ruzi show

suguri:
<:BlobReach:414069175934386177>

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
in terms of grenades

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
soppu is OP

C4Cypher:
The fact that the grenades ignore armor is ... nice, I'm still pumping her damage with equipment

Ruzike:
I couldn't screenshot in time but it was type 95 with summer skin

suguri:
oh

C4Cypher:
What's the deal with soppo's grendade?

suguri:
thats just atago

suguri:
or takao

Shiki:
both nade and normal firing sop is on par with 416

C4Cypher:
Mmk

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
and she's upgradeable to mod 3

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
which makes her even stronger

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
with ronnergate!!!

Shiki:
she doesnt have a useless exo slot

Hecate:
So... RFB is mandatory?

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
<:homeThonk:484732324198744097>

nguuuquaaa:
uh because you use G11 instead of a RF?

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
not mandatory

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
but if you want a sure kill method

nguuuquaaa:
RFs kill jaegers first

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
they can't ignore scouts

Hecate:
I wanna use AR coz they can use nightscope

Hikimouto:
isnt it like normally you just go meh for it, but now playing it over and over in event, it grows on you

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
with scouts in the way, RFs will still aim at scouts

floaty bois don't do much dmg and 3 HG can block their advance

those who read guides won't have MG at early game after all

Aydensnake:
yes, probably need to disable that?

animerelatedlover:
yes

animerelatedlover:
disable auto resupply

nguuuquaaa:
later on you'll want total control on resupply (corpse drag and such) so it's best to get used to it

voler_1:
google said it my phone

voler_1:
and i was stumped

Kane:
connect the card to google play store, my does that google 1 tap transaction thing

voler_1:
i cant

voler_1:
google doesnt open when i try to buy stuff

Luxanna:
lol

voler_1:
ikr

Kane:
<:ShotMink:410655372840402945> open the play store itself and do it there?

voler_1:
does that work?

Luxanna:
I mean you can add your credit card info there

Kane:
should work for any online transactions through it

voler_1:
can i buy stuff directly off the playstore

Kane:
...yes

voler_1:
in app stuff?

LoneWalker:
try getting something like bluestacks and check if it would work from there

Kane:
not IN APP stuff

voler_1:
ye

voler_1:
i meant in app

Kane:
but your connection of card to appstore should correlate to the game

Luxanna:
now when I think of it

voler_1:
gfl doesnt connect to google play

voler_1:
so

Luxanna:
couldn't you just try emulating pixel 3 for example and do it that way

Luxanna:
<:homeThonk:484732324198744097>

voler_1:
idk what to do

LoneWalker:
so lemme get this straight incase im wrong

Kzar:
tfw i thought it was normal to pay from other countries <:thonk9:410657576892497930>

LoneWalker:
you put money into your google play account instead of it being linked directly to your card?

LoneWalker:
and now you cant pay with the money on your google play account

voler_1:
no

voler_1:
my phone has sub 2 iq

Luxanna:
you just can't link the card, rite?

voler_1:
so it cant connect to google play

Luxanna:
welp

Kane:
*how in character is this for FiveSeveN*

Luxanna:
gimme a sec could you

voler_1:
because of that i cant buy stuff

voler_1:
so litteraly anyone who can make in app purchases can help me

Luxanna:
give me a second

Luxanna:
I will try something

Luxanna:
and tell you wether or not does it work

Luxanna:

<@!110493341233209344> how do u make purchases off a xiao mi?

Luxanna:
technically speaking

Luxanna:
you should be able to do it like with all other devices

voler_1:
but i cant

voler_1:
cause in china google is banned

voler_1:

my parents have a thing where they buy phones from china

voler_1:
cause nationalism

Luxanna:
although

Astra:
<:thonk9:410657576892497930>

Luxanna:
installing google play via apk sounds like idiotism

voler_1:
you have to download google play services and all with it

Luxanna:
if you want to do it hte right way you should unlock the bootloader, flash twrp and then either a global rom or open gapps

Pacbough:
my phone is a xiaomi

Pacbough:

Pacbough:

Chiaki:

Chiaki:

voler_1:
i bought it in china

Kitsune:
you can probs get the apk

voler_1:

Pacbough:
xiaomi phones dont come with google play on china rom unless its a hacked rom

Kitsune:
and get the services thing downloaded from somewhere

Luxanna:

voler_1:
yeah

Luxanna:
the dumbest way

voler_1:

Luxanna:

eh, you should have echelons strong enough to automatically S every battle besides elphelt even if you ignore them

StrayedPath:
Man too lazy to do the event

voler_1:
How much is the sangvis elphet costume in American dollars

StrayedPath:
Despite free stuff

StrayedPath:

commie:
20 dorrar

commie:
well, technically 19,99

Cammerhammer:
All the dollar

Cammerhammer:
Personally Magnum Wedding is my pref

Cammerhammer:
Because she looks like such wife material in it

Vinen:
Cam says first intelligent thing today

Vinen:
I still use the snagvis one

Cammerhammer:
Oh it's not bad either

Cammerhammer:
Both her costumes are great

Cammerhammer:
Look at this fucking damaged art though

Vinen:
It looks like very inappropriate stuff is about to rain down on her. <a:t100SEX:474508533442936833>

Slave to the Caffeine:
Well. ..

Slave to the Caffeine:
I have 3 beepos now

art12345:
ah

art12345:
so to level up soap and m1

art12345:

Vinen:
<@128571327127748608> got 4th today <:RibBleeding:415391866822066176>

Why does MP5 have many costume?

JohnTitor:
<:RibDiedInside:414195386199179265>

Cammerhammer:
That's all she has going for her

c3:
^pretty much

Cammerhammer:
Besides an exo that doesn't really fix her main problem

JohnTitor:
We need more Ribeyrolles

JohnTitor:
<:RibDiedInside:414195386199179265>

Cammerhammer:
I think Mica has a secret crush on MP5

c3:
I made one yesterday and today one more, taking more requests tomorrow

Tins37:
Mp5 is good in other games, why not this one?

c3:
real performance has no impact on ingame stats, that simple

Tins37:
Why does g36 have more costume than g36c?

commie:
one is a maid thot

Cammerhammer:
Because meido powah

Chiaki:
cuz imoko loves her child

commie:
the other isn't a maid thot

Chiaki:
and parsley is mia

Tins37:
whos parsely

Pungey:
Parsley was the artist who did kashima in KC

Cammerhammer:
Artist

The Laughing Man:
AL locked up Parsley

The Laughing Man:
They're kidnapping and locking up all artists

Tins37:
AL?

Cammerhammer:
Kancolle 2.0

Chiaki:
auto lane

Tins37:
Oh

Tins37:
worse kantai

Tins37:
so is g36c for ever stuck at 2 costumes?

c3:
maybe not forever, but I wouldn't get my hopes up

The Laughing Man:
Wait what's G36c's second costume?

The Laughing Man:
I know of the yukata costume

Atokani:
the yukata is the only alternative

Atokani:
lol

Tins37:
At least its live2d

commie:
this is what a real echelon looks like

commie:


Cammerhammer:
The realest

Whole Wheat cum:
Ooohhh

Whole Wheat cum:
Purple unit

Whole Wheat cum:
How get

commie:
she's great

commie:
I use her to resupply my corpse draggers

Cammerhammer:
You have to play the event

Whole Wheat cum:
Is she a permanent unlock

commie:
ye

Cammerhammer:
Yes

Whole Wheat cum:
When do you get her

Fiddlekins:
huh, ce flex meme team is surprisingly good at DD

skaianDestiny:
do the event

skaianDestiny:
open loot boxes

commie:
disclaimer

skaianDestiny:
guaranteed from 99 but chance to get it before

commie:
the lootboxes are the drops from the event

commie:
they are not actual loot boxes

Cammerhammer:
They're basically lootboxes under another name

Cammerhammer:
Seithrs

commie:
we're not paying a single ruble to get them :V

Cammerhammer:
True

Vinen:
<a:BolbHyperParty:498699386931642373>

Whole Wheat cum:
It's gonna be hard to get s rank

Whole Wheat cum:
On the event things

commie:
that looks like it would kill an epileptic person

skaianDestiny:
you just need to s-rank the bosses

Whole Wheat cum:
Oh ye this is the dream team

Cammerhammer:
You only have to S-rank the fights

commie:
the first and second maps are pretty easy even for a beginner

commie:
you can get 6 guaranteed seithr a day

commie:
E3 is also reasonably easy

Whole Wheat cum:
Btw why do mgs buff shotguns but there's no shotguns

commie:
it's really elphelt that might be a bit more difficult

Cammerhammer:
You can't get shotguns in regular production

commie:
but there are shotguns

Cammerhammer:
Only heavy production

Whole Wheat cum:
Oh

skaianDestiny:
shotguns in heavy production

skaianDestiny:
6k/2k/6k/4k

Cammerhammer:
You can't afford shotguns

suguri:
you can't tell me what I can and can't afford

commie:
me neither but I still pull them :V

commie:
disclaimer: I don't actually pull shotguns

suguri:
*buys a boat*

Cammerhammer:
Just focus on your AR/SMG teams for now

skaianDestiny:
can afford one (1) heavy production roll

commie:
I pulled a soviet designated marksman's shotgun

Cammerhammer:
I still only pull for shotties once weekly

Vinen:
I ragecraft for shotties every so often

Vinen:
but I have at least 3 of all but KSG and Floof

commie:
last time I did that I pulled an SVD and a 3* AR

Vinen:
(Have 1 KSG)

commie:
so ragecrafting shotguns is not ok

Vinen:
only 2 pulls is not a ragecraft

commie:
it is when it costs 10 quick prods to pull them faster :V

Vinen:
its a bad decision

commie:
I actually went at it later when they were done

commie:
I think that was the first time I had over 20k resources

skaianDestiny:
cant wait for next shotgun to be added

commie:
after that I barely had anything

skaianDestiny:
spas 12~

Whole Wheat cum:
Do I s rank the boss fight or the mission

skaianDestiny:
boss

Rose ‚ôß:
spas 12 is just thicc

Rose ‚ôß:
not so great as a SG

commie:
you S rank the boss

Whole Wheat cum:
We talking bout shotguns?

commie:
that is, the enemy on the command centre

Whole Wheat cum:
What shotguns are in the game

skaianDestiny:
go to index and filter by shotguns

commie:
don't bother because you'll never pull them :^)

N312:
Uh oh, corpse dragging is easier than I thought, looks like this is my life now.

Vinen:
<a:BolbHyperParty:498699386931642373>

Whole Wheat cum:
Jeezus that's a seziure above me

Vinen:


Vinen:
I need to start dragging again

Vinen:
but too lazy

Vinen:
even have G11 in the party for drag

commie:
okay whose idea was it for that emote?

commie:
I don't have epilepsy but hell that is visually annoying as fuck

Vinen:
Someone who hates the world

DocPropane:
<@274652519353810944> it's a particular strat for grinding

DocPropane:
where you turn auto-resupply off and only resupply your damage dealers

DocPropane:
to save resources

Vinen:
for example

Vinen:
in my image I have 2 G11

N312:
I'm out here rolling for 5* equips day in and day out, can't be spending resources on levelling at the same time.

Vinen:
second G11 would be in an echelon alone

Vinen:
resupply her

Vinen:
don't resupply main party

Vinen:
run mission.

Vinen:
Swap G11s

Vinen:
repeat

commie:
you should probably link him the guide instead

Vinen:
That sounds like effort

Vinen:
just to get people to click it if they sort by power

Vinen:
not many people have 45K+ echelons

Vinen:
so it tends to get used

Chibbi:
Mgsquad? For 45k?

Vinen:
yeah

Vinen:
I don't have floof so I can't break 50K

Vinen:
<:RibBleeding:415391866822066176>

The Laughing Man:
Can you break 50k with Elphelt

Vinen:
will find out

Vinen:
shes not 100 yet

Vinen:
nor x5

Chibbi:
Who's floof? Lol

Cammerhammer:
Open her mouth

Cammerhammer:
Stuff CR in

The Laughing Man:
SAT8 = floof

Vinen:
Suguri 50K flex inc

Chibbi:
Ahhh

suguri:
<:SOPMODfunnyfeic:427804752701554719>

Vinen:
Suguri is the first echelon I tend to use

Vinen:
since he is at the top of my list sorted by CE

Vinen:
if I'm actually doing that daily

suguri:
<:minkLove:427816604659613707>

suguri:
you used to be the top

suguri:
but then aug got floof

art12345:
Ayyy i got soap now

The Laughing Man:
üöø

art12345:
I herd that sop is real good

Vinen:
all the AR team is good

art12345:
But i got no time to level my girls

art12345:
Maybe combat reports

art12345:
The 7 i am creating so far will help level them?

Rose ‚ôß:
Do start leveling your girls

Rose ‚ôß:
make your life easier

Rose ‚ôß:
or a challenge if you want

art12345:
I only have m1 and soap so far

The Laughing Man:
Get to 4-3E and start grinding out levels there

art12345:
And who do i level them with

art12345:
My food and ammo is running lowish

art12345:
And i need to burst down missions to unlock the high paying out with rations and ammo stuff

art12345:
I just gave up doing it legit now, imma go abuse my level 100 friends

suguri:
use any dps doll at 70x4 or higher

art12345:
Hm

art12345:
Is it a good idea to sic my friends on the boss?

art12345:
Or am i supposed to beat the boss myself?

suguri:
if you retreat them just before they kill it

commie:
that's what friends are for :^)

suguri:
you can sneak in to snipe the rewards

suguri:
<:OK:500692128058572800>

commie:
exploit your friends like a capitalist

art12345:
Umm

art12345:
I got not 70x4

art12345:
Also

art12345:
I reached my parts cap

art12345:
I have over 10k parts

art12345:
I assume i can't produce no more parts until i drop under 10k?

The Laughing Man:
You can't get parts from natural regen after you hit the softcap

Kyle:
you can still get more though

The Laughing Man:
But you can still get it from logistics and quests

Rose ‚ôß:
If you mean by the passive regen, you can increase that softcap with a higher commander level

art12345:
Oh

art12345:
Higher commander level eh?

Vinen:
for example

Vinen:
at 129 my softcap is 74300

Vinen:
Thats the only benefit of leveling FYI

Vinen:
is increased softcap

commie:
and dolls from milestones

Cammerhammer:
It's a pretty good benefit

suguri:
means you get more out of passive regen after a rateup

art12345:
Btw

art12345:
How do you increase t doll capacity

art12345:
I only have 100

Rose ‚ôß:
buy it in shop

Rose ‚ôß:
<:kalinaGem:427818502141902848>

Cammerhammer:
You have to buy expansions

art12345:
Also

suguri:
`expand D O L L`

art12345:
Am i underleveled

suguri:
*FEATURE LENGTH*

art12345:


art12345:
For doing 3-4

commie:
probably not unless you've been levelling 20 dolls at the same time

Cammerhammer:
Possibly. You can go back and replay levels to get some more experience on your dolls

Whole Wheat cum:

Chibbi:
Sop and m16 with 3 randoms optimal?

Shoot

masho the goat üêê:
Is  it a good idea to raise more of the same tdoll?

masho the goat üêê:
Or should u just scrap for core

masho the goat üêê:
I got like 5 welrods and ump sisters and a bunch others

But I already have em maxed out

„ÉÅ„É´„Éª„Çª„É≥„Éë„Ç§:
I mean depends I have 2 Welrods because I use her in 2 different teams

masho the goat üêê:
True

„ÉÅ„É´„Éª„Çª„É≥„Éë„Ç§:
Orrr you can use them for dummy links

masho the goat üêê:
Will they always have the same exact stats? If you raise 2 different ones to level 100

Why not just replace her

Wait

art12345:
Does she get stronger every time

voler_1:
No

art12345:
Urf internet

art12345:
Thine ass got thrashed

voler_1:
She just gets more reliable

art12345:
She shrekt 2 of my units thi

Just get all of AR team

And use them

voler_1:
Also

voler_1:
Level your smga

voler_1:
Smgs

art12345:
Yea, sten and skor0

art12345:
Are kinda ehh rite now

art12345:
Wait, by 'reliable' her power rank also goes up?

Rose ‚ôß:
Skorpion is fine for where you're at, do expect to replace skorp later

voler_1:
No I was making an l85 joke

Rose ‚ôß:
do find someone to replace sten, like ump9 or ump45, ump45 is the better choice

Rose ‚ôß:
ingram works as well

art12345:
Holy shit

art12345:
She does get stronger

art12345:
Oh god

You've only dipped your toes in the pool

elphelt gets stronger each time you beat her?

Kid:
crimson red dream

art12345:
Um

no

she gets dead

each time you kill her

Kid:
basically elphelt dies if you kill her

art12345:
Intruder

art12345:
Or something of second rabbit stage

voler_1:
Lol

voler_1:
What

voler_1:
Really

voler_1:
She gets stronger?

voler_1:
She just dies so fast I don't notice

art12345:
I mean

art12345:
Before she scratched just the smgs

art12345:
But then the second time she ripped through my front line and started to whack on my backline, rip chocolate loli

Kyle:
weird

art12345:
Maybe it was bad luck, idk

art12345:
Or good luck at the beginning

art12345:
But..well...most of you are so high leveled i doubt it makes a difference

art12345:
She has to die 2 more times, which i have a feeling will be a great pain

Kyle:
i didnt notice when i did it, and i first did it at like level 50-60

art12345:
Well

art12345:
I am only level 20

Vinen:
Leveling is stupid fast

Vinen:
at least account level

until like 100

Ppk I might use instead of contender

„ÉÅ„É´„Éª„Çª„É≥„Éë„Ç§:
<:thonk9:410657576892497930>

„ÉÅ„É´„Éª„Çª„É≥„Éë„Ç§:
Is it bad to have more rof on mgs?

Pungey:
Pointless since the effect of rof buffs on MGs is minimal

„ÉÅ„É´„Éª„Çª„É≥„Éë„Ç§:
I see, even tho ppk gives Crit chance a ton rof and damage ?

Pungey:
What rof basically does is speed up your MG reload time by a little, but your MGs are supposed to kill most enemies within the first volley

„ÉÅ„É´„Éª„Çª„É≥„Éë„Ç§:
True but let's say this

„ÉÅ„É´„Éª„Çª„É≥„Éë„Ç§:
Becuase I use bar okay Bar with mod3 the faster she reloads etc meaning more uptime of her 2nd passive having more rof would be better there

„ÉÅ„É´„Éª„Çª„É≥„Éë„Ç§:
Especially with machine guns critting most of the time

Pungey:
I dont have the exact numbers but the impact on reload time is almost neligible

„ÉÅ„É´„Éª„Çª„É≥„Éë„Ç§:
Ah okay,

„ÉÅ„É´„Éª„Çª„É≥„Éë„Ç§:
Idk tbh

„ÉÅ„É´„Éª„Çª„É≥„Éë„Ç§:
Ppk with all the Benefits is hard

„ÉÅ„É´„Éª„Çª„É≥„Éë„Ç§:
Especially there tile formation

„ÉÅ„É´„Éª„Çª„É≥„Éë„Ç§:
Its like perfect

„ÉÅ„É´„Éª„Çª„É≥„Éë„Ç§:
Now question in a Wa2k svd comp would you rather have grizz or Ppk?

„ÉÅ„É´„Éª„Çª„É≥„Éë„Ç§:
I would use 5.7 but shes in my exodia team

Pungey:
Grizzly, Wa2k SVD hits rof cap with just calico

„ÉÅ„É´„Éª„Çª„É≥„Éë„Ç§:

„ÉÅ„É´„Éª„Çª„É≥„Éë„Ç§:
Swap welrod before battle starts

Pungey:
There is a reason why you use SVD at 7 instead of wa

PotatoTheFirst:
you don't need to swap welrod when your team just kills everything

Pungey:
For that exact set up

„ÉÅ„É´„Éª„Çª„É≥„Éë„Ç§:
Wa has higher dmg takes priority

doesn't Wa2k's rof cap?

if you tap anywhere outside the transaction window while it's processing it's cancelled

Juliet Delta Tango 1-5:
Happy I finally got M4 to 90. ~~I did use combat reports though, fuck grinding for levels~~

art12345:
Hm what equips should i be going for

art12345:
I recentlyish unlocked them

Juliet Delta Tango 1-5:
Depends on what Doll you're using.

art12345:
Just dis squad

art12345:
I am yet to use m4a1

Juliet Delta Tango 1-5:
If the Doll is a grenadier Doll (molotovs and grenades), slap on an EOT for extra damage.

art12345:
And grinding her up will be tuff

Vinen:
Stop lewding Sten <:shortycuffs:415012355596877824>

art12345:
But i got combat reports?

Juliet Delta Tango 1-5:
Crit scipe on M14, mate

art12345:
Idk how those work

Juliet Delta Tango 1-5:
Crit scopes for all ARs too

art12345:
I guess i givr them to m4a1 and she gets leveled?

Juliet Delta Tango 1-5:
Yep

Juliet Delta Tango 1-5:
Each report gives a fixed 3000 exp.

art12345:
Sten has been really doing work being a meatshield

art12345:
So idk when to replace her

art12345:
Or who

Juliet Delta Tango 1-5:
She's nice early game, but later on if you get UMP45, use her

Juliet Delta Tango 1-5:
Or maybe keep Sten

art12345:
I am trying to get ump rite now

art12345:
I herd chocolate loli is good

Juliet Delta Tango 1-5:
I've seen still use Sten late-game.

Juliet Delta Tango 1-5:
FNC is a good AR.

art12345:
Idk about ots, skorpion, and m14 tho

art12345:
I REALLY need m14 dups asap so i can dummy link her to be useable

art12345:
At the same time, i am using 400 400 400 30 for smg, which means i won't get any rifles

art12345:
But rabbit seems coolio

art12345:
Some1 here told me to do rabbit thrice per day

art12345:


art12345:
But why thrice specifically

art12345:
Does it close after 3?

Juliet Delta Tango 1-5:
There's a daily limit on the first two maps

art12345:
Ooof

art12345:
So i should have been doing it then for the first map

Juliet Delta Tango 1-5:
The daily limit for the later two missions is two, by the way

art12345:
The second map, i haven't tried yet but i believe will be tuff

art12345:
Since uhh

Takamura Yui:
At this rate i might build a M4 Memeblaster/exodia echelon before IWS drops by.

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
damn that's far

Takamura Yui:
You have to fight....agent for her?

Takamura Yui:
Or something along those lines?

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
or worse

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
every single SF boss

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
since isn't there a boss like that?

Kitsune:
that's agent

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
agent, along with all SF bosses

Kitsune:
agent summons every other sf boss

Takamura Yui:
<:ShotMink:410655372840402945>

Kitsune:
it's not that bad

Kitsune:
if anything the fight's just really annoying

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
so if you beat that agent

Kitsune:
not guaranteed

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
you get a 2nd M4A1?

Kitsune:
lul

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
nani?

suguri:

Takamura Yui:

suguri:

Kitsune:

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
you are telling me to fight every single boss

Kitsune:
yes

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
for thousands of times

Kitsune:
very worth

suguri:
could be once

Kitsune:
m4 is a good ptsd

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
to have a chance for a dupe m4A1

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
she's good yes

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
but

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
that is too much suffer

Kitsune:
shrug

Kitsune:
you get used to it

suguri:
if everybody was good at math lotteries would be bankrupt

Kitsune:
lmao

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
implying math would help you win lotteries

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
<:NOPE:500694246429556757>

Kitsune:
no, it helps you understand the chances

Kitsune:
which are basically negligible

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
drop rate is

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
probably worse than hoxy

suguri:


Kitsune:
so it becomes not worth

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
since fight is harder

Kitsune:
eh

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
takes longer

Kitsune:
i'd say it's more straightforward though

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
no kiting?

Lilya Starikova:

Kitsune:

The Laughing Man:
To make grinding a bit more bearable

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
it's against every single SF boss

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
I don't think you can just

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
afk it

Kitsune:
it's not every single one of them

Kitsune:
it's like the field bosses

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
ok no ouroboros and architect

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
no gager either I suppose

Kitsune:
yeah, no AOE stuff

The Laughing Man:
Isn't scarecrow dead?

Sparkee100:

Lilya Starikova:
Did someone say

Lilya Starikova:
**CoRE HELL**

Chiaki:
but that team should have no problems doing the first two maps of the event

Plague:

Lilya Starikova:

Plague:

art12345:
Ooof

Lilya Starikova:

art12345:
Also, been grinding

Vinen:
my ammo is garbage

art12345:
And my ammo looks a little bit..low

Vinen:
but thankfully ammo not needed for HC ragercrafting

Vinen:
<:SOPMODfunnyfeic:427804752701554719>

Lilya Starikova:
MG/SG is fun to use but ammo is weee

Oxidian:
core hell is just an illusion, I have 1000 spare cores by now

Oxidian:
the only hell is 5* SGs

Vinen:
^

Vinen:
I have all dolls

Vinen:
but

Vinen:
floof

Vinen:
all gatcha ones thatis

c3:
^it's true

art12345:
And my m14 is a little bjt behind cuz i got no spares and was told to not use cores if she is so common

Chiaki:
just make it so you don't need sat8

Chiaki:
then you're out of your own hell

Oxidian:
I'm missing both 5* SGs and Negev/MG4...

art12345:
Who should i look to replace in my group

Oxidian:
sten

Awakening:
sten

Chiaki:
depends on who you're putting in

Oxidian:
try ingram if you have one

Awakening:
tru, replace sten with better smg

Vinen:
Sten ü§¢

Lilya Starikova:
is this Art12345 guy new player?

Vinen:
Replace Sten with IDW is an improvement

Vinen:
<:SOPMODfunnyfeic:427804752701554719>

Oxidian:
replace idw with nothing for an improvement

Vinen:
at least IDW can't be turned into a core

art12345:
Yea

art12345:
I am newish

art12345:
I just started yesterday?

art12345:

Oxidian:
anyway I'd just use support echelon to blast through everything up to 4-3E

c3:
üôè

Oxidian:
4-3E also drops ingram

art12345:
Huh

art12345:
Also when should i be using quick repair contracts

art12345:
Maybe for girls that take HOURS to fix?

art12345:
Like yeesh

Vinen:
Yeah

c3:
literally whenver you feel like it. you'll drown in them eventually

Vinen:
go ahead they drop by dollar bills on strippers

art12345:
I already wasted so many tho

Vinen:
most of us have > 1000

Vinen:
at this point

art12345:
Because i didn't realize healing on helipads

art12345:
Used them

Chiaki:
they come at a fair share but the more you play the more you use it i guess

Kid:
hey whomo

Kid:

Chiaki:
<:YES:427808453868781568>

Kid:

Chiaki:


Chiaki:

art12345:
So, the umps

Kid:

c3:

dropkick_tm:
<@139251378005606401> whos choco?

c3:
I wouldn't take this guy serious

Ashina:
Here's a more clean Remastered Ribby Base

art12345:
I guess go use the 400 400 400 30 formula?

Ashina:
<:RibDiedInside:414195386199179265>

art12345:
Over and over until i get ump45

Chiaki:
400 400 91 30 is generalist for smgs

Ashina:
Don't ask why I did this

art12345:
Oh i should use 400 400 91 30 instead then?

Chiaki:
yeah

c3:
as a beginner both is good

Chiaki:
or 430 430 430 230, i dunno

suguri:
you could do 400/400/400/30 as a beginner

Chiaki:
a lot of people recommend this one but it's huge pool

suguri:
no wait

Oxidian:
I dunno about that, I always get shit dolls with 30 somewhere

Oxidian:
or thompson

SleepyDuck:
ü§î

Xeal:
so someon has to cover for them in the meantime

SleepyDuck:
sooo sacrifice thompson?

Chiaki:
so they'll hit you regardless

Xeal:
oh its just 2 jupiters.

Ashina:
Damn, No Ribby MOD

Xeal:
lol

Chiaki:
why use slow ass RF against 12 armor <:thonk9:410657576892497930>

Nihilo:
Why would she get one.

Nihilo:
Ribs‚Äô artist stopped working for Mica

SleepyDuck:
NOOOoooooo

SleepyDuck:
D:

SleepyDuck:
Welp, that just ruined my day

SleepyDuck:
Perfect way to start the week, realise that no new ribey art is coming

Xeal:
DD EX+ has 6 jupiters. It's essential to take the closest 2 jupiter nodes down to get that extra AP <:OK:500692128058572800>

SleepyDuck:
Nani the FuCK

Chiaki:
didn't people farm jupiters in E1-2?

Chiaki:
that should be less terrible

Xeal:
Anywhere jupiter is, is a farming spot.

Xeal:
E1-2 is easy yeah

Yorihime:
Is there any good comp except sacrificing low end dolls

Chiaki:
e1-2 is literally down the path

SleepyDuck:
Im kinda scared for AW now

SleepyDuck:
<:SOPMODfunnyfeic:427804752701554719>

Chiaki:
for consistent farming no, it's not worth the repair cost

Xeal:
it's just tedious, nothing bad.

Yorihime:
Fine and what is the reward at the end

Yorihime:
<:thonk9:410657576892497930>

Chiaki:
the event distributed something akin to the seithr we're getting now

Chiaki:
lootboxes

Xeal:
red packets. another event alongside the main event.

Chiaki:
except these ones gave gems

Nihilo:
Power down the damn things, and you won‚Äôt have a reason to be scared.
I‚Äôll say the particular KR players did a shit job at imprinting this idea you need to brute force Jupiters.

Nihilo:
It‚Äôs entirely unnecessary.

Chiaki:
yeah you can just encircle them, the game will tell you how

Rggcd:
you can brute force them if you think you're hard

Rggcd:
otherwise be smart and just power them down lmao

Chiaki:
some maps will have gimmick, tho

Oxidian:
but it's faster to take them down

Nihilo:
Faster isn‚Äôt better.

HazardousJay:
TENO HEIKA BANZAIIIIIII

Nihilo:
This is a month long event.

Nihilo:
What are they gonna lose out?

SleepyDuck:
wait so

SleepyDuck:
why did the koreans brute force it then

SleepyDuck:
<:thonk9:410657576892497930>

Xeal:
gotta git dem fast points in EX map gremps.

Xeal:
encircling takes time, they didnt have the patience.

Xeal:
and some are shortcuts

SleepyDuck:
Rip

Nihilo:
To save time especially for red packet farming or opening up a path.

Nihilo:
They had lay of the lane.

Nihilo:
And prior insight.

Nihilo:
They just didn‚Äôt have the patience.

Nihilo:
To otherwise trek cautiously.

Nihilo:
And remember. That brute force thing wasn‚Äôt even a normal thing.

Oxidian:
what's resources when you can just throw money at the monitor

Nihilo:
It was just the first thing seen.

Nihilo:
With all those videos.

Yorihime:
Imagine just Mica team being like "wtf these damn Koreans" and seeing them using disposable various cheap dolls for farming

Chiaki:
<@358462916296704010> if you can, at least do the first two maps 3 times a day to get the rewards, they're worth it

Chiaki:
if you have only one squad it is a bit complicated at first

Oxidian:
btw don't even try to farm 4* if it's not an event doll

Nihilo:
You have to traverse a lot of land.

some maps force you to wait

SleepyDuck:

Add the navigational obstacles like Jupiters.

SleepyDuck:

SleepyDuck:
someone here said something about brute forcing jupiters

SleepyDuck:
sec lemme check chat logs

that's dumb and makes no sense

They were bullshitting.

jupiters have a long walk until you get to them

SleepyDuck:
welp rip, seems like the only way is around

SleepyDuck:
<:SOPMODfunnyfeic:427804752701554719>

Chiaki:
or just encircle them like a smart man

Xeal:
FNC runs were popular, with sacrificial dolls.

Chiaki:
or turn auto retreat on

Xeal:
<:happythoughts:363732896273399808>

Can't you beat jupiters using G36c and Thompson ?

they start bombing the instant battle starts

SleepyDuck:
<@!84323276083433472>  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txXZLSp1ap0

Chiaki:
the exploit with jupiters is that they have very low rate of fire, but high damage

Nihilo:
And oaths are better left to practical candidates.

Chen:
i was curious as to their lines tho

Nihilo:
They have lines.

Nihilo:
Although for normal Dolls.

Chiaki:
i like 416 but god damn did she get the shaft

Kane:
seems that wafrom tyhe numbers

Kane:
you'd think she'd be better, being what seems to be a reoccuring character

Chiaki:
~~the numbers are a bit irrelevant because they only take the grenade hitting one enemy into account, diverse situations can make 416's nade be an actual threat and sometimes even better than a self buffer~~

Chiaki:
<:OK:500692128058572800>

Kane:
her 40mike is rather nice...

HazardousJay:
~~at least 416 didnt get shafted as hard as AK47~~

I love a woman with a 320GL

It hurts to say but I never used 47. She never fit into any of my echelons and her copies are burnt for cores. She herself remains safely in the barracks though

Kane:
drinking with AS VAL

Chiaki:
you can take solace in the fact that almost all 5* we have today are getting shafted by mods

Kane:
iuts the little things, huh

Chiaki:
i just learned ak47 has the lowest acc of all ARs

HazardousJay:
Yeah

Chiaki:
why tho

Sparkee100:
416 has no window for upgrade

HazardousJay:
Thats why i slap an ACOG on her face

HazardousJay:
Thatll make her hit shit

Sparkee100:
That's the shitty part

Chiaki:
well her skill raises acc

Chiaki:

HazardousJay:
MOAR ACCURACY

somerandom101person:
I can't chat more on this channel cause school days and event.

HazardousJay:
That and i guess the common perception that ak47is inaccurate

HazardousJay:
/shrug

Kane:
416 is still the T-Doll to stand beside me, and serve as Squad leader of the front line. A cstoic angel of vengeance!

HazardousJay:
A kraut angel of vengeance*

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
an AR that raises acc

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
pitiful

Kane:
*quiet coughing in the back of the auditorium*

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
since ARs have good accuracy overall

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
but if one has such a bad accuracy

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
to have to raise it with skill

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
it's just

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
sad

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
*feeling sad while throwing ak47 into the grinder*

Kane:
dont worry, russias been doing that to AKs for half a century +

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
AK-74u is good tho

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
<:thonk9:410657576892497930>

Kane:
mm....5.45...

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
While active, any enemy units dealt damage to AK-74U will receive a 50% damage and accuracy reducing penalty (Elite units receives 25% instead), penalty lasts for 5 seconds, skill lasts for 5 seconds.

Kane:
I was talking about Real life but wow, IG 74u aint bad.

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
first point event so I supposed anyone who played during that time would have her

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
unless

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
there would be people who thought

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
"meh I'll farm her in later events"

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
and didn't attempt to get her

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:

her skill in the costume is like that

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
it takes a while for the swords to come out

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
but enemies still can move

during that animation

so if they move forward

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:

Yandere ÔΩΩÔæûÔΩ≤‚Çç‚Çç‡∏áÀòœâÀò‡∏ß‚Åæ‚ÅæÔΩΩÔæûÔΩ≤:
I've been thinking about leveling mine and pairing her with my WA instead of SVD, seems like that team has pretty good DPS output at least in the formation gen

Yandere ÔΩΩÔæûÔΩ≤‚Çç‚Çç‡∏áÀòœâÀò‡∏ß‚Åæ‚ÅæÔΩΩÔæûÔΩ≤:
would be ideal to have five seven but I think I have to level my stechkin instead

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
I'd suggest pairing RFs based on buff type

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
RoF and FP

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
RoF with RoF

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
FP with FP

Kane:
>G11 is 4:04
Oh motherFUCKERS
<:RodTime:484729471728091147>

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
so you can focus the HG type

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
WA/SVD -> FP buff HGs

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
lee/IWS/M14 -> RoF buff HGs

Yandere ÔΩΩÔæûÔΩ≤‚Çç‚Çç‡∏áÀòœâÀò‡∏ß‚Åæ‚ÅæÔΩΩÔæûÔΩ≤:
You don't just give WA and SVD more RoF? I definitely had the wrong idea till now then lol

Yandere ÔΩΩÔæûÔΩ≤‚Çç‚Çç‡∏áÀòœâÀò‡∏ß‚Åæ‚ÅæÔΩΩÔæûÔΩ≤:
Hmm, might have to change around my MG team a bit then

Yandere ÔΩΩÔæûÔΩ≤‚Çç‚Çç‡∏áÀòœâÀò‡∏ß‚Åæ‚ÅæÔΩΩÔæûÔΩ≤:
The fattest dmg buff HG happens to be on it, least I think so <:thonk9:410657576892497930>

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
giving wa/svd 1 RoF buff is fine

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
but they also need FP buff

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
but lee/IWS/M14 needs full RoF

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
since they hit like trucks in the first place

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
when we get G28 she'll need the same thing

Yandere ÔΩΩÔæûÔΩ≤‚Çç‚Çç‡∏áÀòœâÀò‡∏ß‚Åæ‚ÅæÔΩΩÔæûÔΩ≤:

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:

Yorihime:
Her shield will be usefull

HazardousJay:
dont bother with rifles for now

HazardousJay:
whats important is to get your core squad up to speed

Chiaki:
1rf = only if that RF is m14

Cryolock:
^

Cryolock:
m14 is free anyway

Cryolock:
might as well

Cryolock:

HazardousJay:
yeet

Chiaki:

HazardousJay:

HazardousJay:

mojibake:
Thompson and FF F2k are my best right now

mojibake:

STAR Some SMG
M4A1 Some SMG (pref ump45)

Chiaki:

Chiaki:
story progression requires you to fight judge

Chiaki:

Cryolock:
^

Reaper:
:homete:

Chiaki:

Chiaki:
<:OK:500692128058572800>

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:

Cryolock:

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
only 4 times

Cryolock:

Cryolock:

Yorihime:

Cryolock:

Chiaki:

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
> crazy yandere face

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
<:thonk9:410657576892497930>

Cryolock:
<@116638489340149769> yes

Reaper:
hmm

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
one is mk23

Reaper:
Ye

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
the other is a HG with acc buff

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
up to you which one that is

Reaper:
Spitfire good?

Yorihime:
Even if there isn't the stepped bolt carrier group he probably just typed and used one of the first results on Google and it's most often Polish AKM due to the shiny bcg

Reaper:
Gives 20%

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
spitfire is good

Reaper:
Acc

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
but eh....

Yorihime:
And was to lazy to do the stepped bcg

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
do you have colt?

Cryolock:
spitfire btr for 2mg 2sg formation

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
the cola addicted

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
or SPP-20

Reaper:
LOL the 5star? Nuh

HazardousJay:
is that so.

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
no

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
4*

Reaper:
oh hmm nu

HazardousJay:
well tbh its still a kalashnikov. so eh i guess

Cryolock:
3MG is btr tho

Cryolock:
3MG 1HG 1SG

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
well if he's running elphelt

Cryolock:
PK PKP MG5 Mk23 Elphelt

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
2MG is fin

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
fine*

HazardousJay:
a polish kalashnikov, but still a kalashnikov regardless

Reaper:
I was thinking 3mg too

Reaper:
I have mk3

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
MG3?

Reaper:
23*

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
oh

Cryolock:
MG5 > MG3

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
then that's fine

Reaper:
The pistol

Cryolock:
wait

Yorihime:
Btw your list is wrong

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
MG3 is trash

Cryolock:
yep mg5

Reaper:
I have mg5

HazardousJay:
well it aint mine, got it from some russian dude lol

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
MG5, PK and PKP

Reaper:
I use her in my main tho she OP

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
put these 3 in an echelon

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
they'll shred

Yorihime:
Even if it's an anachronistic designation of firearms for practical purpose it's still wrong on some points especially the "AK-47" part

Reaper:
Is hng

Reaper:
So 3mg if I got mk23 and elphelt?

Reaper:
Or 2 and some other pistol

Cryolock:
3 should be btr

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
mk23 works for any MG echelon

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
3 for higher effectiveness

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
2 for balancing purpose

Cryolock:
2mg kills a lot slower

Cryolock:
I only have 2mg2sg formation

Cryolock:
it sucks

Reaper:
xD

Reaper:
I'll run 3 MGs then

Reaper:
M1919 any good?

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:

Reaper:
Oh ok

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
but she's ugly

Reaper:
xD

Cryolock:

mojibake:
Yo

Reaper:
What are some other good MGs

Cryolock:
M2HB LWMMG and M1919 are the lower tier MGs that are good

Reaper:
oooo

mojibake:
How's Gr MP5? Thompson lite?

c3:
>m2 lower tier

Cryolock:

Cryolock:

mojibake:

mojibake:

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:

HazardousJay:

HazardousJay:

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:

Cryolock:
hm i personally think mp5 with sepc equip is ok

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:

mojibake:
Also

HazardousJay:
there are better alternatives over MG3

Reaper:
Wait so she's crap?

Cryolock:
<@!197917022623891466> mg3 kinda eh

HazardousJay:
MG42 even does better than her

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
like MG4?

Reaper:
Or good

HazardousJay:
<:SOPMODfunnyfeic:427804752701554719>

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
<:GudaCano:427805886757601280>

Chiaki:
her special equip at +0 is better than a t4 exo

mojibake:
Should I go 3 smg 2 ar or add a rifle?

Hot Sexy Birb:
***Master has spoken.
That you shall come.
That you shall definitely come.

That if I rip you apart,
tear off limbs,
and extract your memory,
I shall acquire the "answer".
She has spoken.***

SSR Best Lamp:
Wow

SSR Best Lamp:
Korean

SSR Best Lamp:
How nice

Chiaki:
what you can do is make 3 mini squads with 2 dps and a tank, that might save some rsc all around, nyan

Brazzendausken:
I haven't seen them

SSR Best Lamp:
Yeah

SSR Best Lamp:
Quite common

SSR Best Lamp:
ICS makes them

Brazzendausken:
ICS does? <:thonk9:410657576892497930>

Brazzendausken:
I don't remember this

SSR Best Lamp:
Yeah

Brazzendausken:

SSR Best Lamp:

SSR Best Lamp:
Let me find it

Saitama:
Gah

HazardousJay:
*bratatatatata*

Saitama:
If you use RFs it's fine,

Saitama:
But if you have tanks and MGs, it's uh

Saitama:
<:hkStare2:414084643848192006>

HazardousJay:
you know what we need? AEGIS bots with MG's on em

HazardousJay:
<:mk48LUL:500681251733110785>

Saitama:
I mean

Saitama:
Aren't Manticores just a bigger version of that?

Saitama:

Saitama:
God

Saitama:
Where the fuck are our vehicles?

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:

SSR Best Lamp:

 Close enough In my opinion

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
<:mk48LUL:500681251733110785>

Saitama:
They've got Arachnid Heavy Tanks, laser tanks, gigantic artillery, ad gundams!

SSR Best Lamp:
A little different

SSR Best Lamp:
But it‚Äôs hard to get perfect

Saitama:
WHERE'S OUR STUFF HUH GNK?

Brazzendausken:
OwO they really do

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
they are the girls

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
Girls and Kryuger

Brazzendausken:

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
<:mk48LUL:500681251733110785>

SSR Best Lamp:


SSR Best Lamp:
Yeah

SSR Best Lamp:
But it locks

SSR Best Lamp:
There‚Äôs also this

Brazzendausken:
that ICS is a copy of the PRS gen 3

Brazzendausken:
whereas that one last pictured and on GFL Super SASS is gen 2

Brazzendausken:
but close enough yeah

SSR Best Lamp:
But painting is in order

SSR Best Lamp:
Honestly I‚Äôll hit up my friend about cosplaying

Brazzendausken:
hm... so are you willing to spend a bit more though?

SSR Best Lamp:
It all depends on her

Saitama:
Post pictures~

SSR Best Lamp:
Oh I have the ICS stock lying around

Brazzendausken:
oh you have it

SSR Best Lamp:
Imma get some FDE paint tomorrow

Brazzendausken:
okay, I was going to say there is a shop to get the PTS PRS gen 2 stocks for about $90

Brazzendausken:

SSR Best Lamp:
But cross gender cosplay disgust me

Brazzendausken:
so you just have to paint the cheekrest black

Pungey:
~~I love big butts and i cannot lie~~

SSR Best Lamp:

SSR Best Lamp:

Brazzendausken:

Strela:
Huh? Rabbit hunt is after ch 8?

Hot Sexy Birb:

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
mint chocolate broccoli is not

salty emp:
what the fuck is hot sexy birb

animerelatedlover:
Hi birb santa

salty emp:
and what the fuck is a pineaplle

SSR Best Lamp:
R/airsoft in itself isn‚Äôt degenerate

SSR Best Lamp:
But the discord is

Brazzendausken:
he wanted cheap parts

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
105 cores needed

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
0 cores have

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
this is gonna take a while

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
<:RibBleeding:415391866822066176>

SSR Best Lamp:
But my plan is to take a default wide magwell AR base

SSR Best Lamp:
Add some ghetto custom parts

SSR Best Lamp:
And give it to my friend

SSR Best Lamp:
Dress her up

SSR Best Lamp:
And pictures

SSR Best Lamp:
<:toot:414068992114688003>

SSR Best Lamp:
Profit

Kane:
this is some weird GFL talking

Chiaki:
tfw you miss a crit with 99% crit chance https://puu.sh/C7SJM/fdbf46cc8c.png

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
babushka!!!

Draconex:
Bababushka

Brazzendausken:
as long as you use an SR25 with a PTS PRS stock, replace the original barrel with a 20" threaded barrel, get a couple packs of Magpul XTM covers in green and tan, and get a tan 8" suppressor, it should be perfect

SSR Best Lamp:
Yes

SSR Best Lamp:
Now I just need to find the uniform

SSR Best Lamp:
And hair accessory

SSR Best Lamp:
My friend looks almost exactly like super sass

SSR Best Lamp:
I think she has some coloured lenses

Brazzendausken:
and for extra bonus points, 3D print the proper adjustable gas block and make a proper-looking mag

SSR Best Lamp:
Yes

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
hmmm

SSR Best Lamp:
How tall is Super SASS?

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
why do some people rate NZ75 as top tier

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
<:thonk9:410657576892497930>

SSR Best Lamp:
NZ75 good tsundre

Brazzendausken:
5'2" is always a safe bet

SSR Best Lamp:
Hmm

SSR Best Lamp:
That‚Äôs not good

SSR Best Lamp:
My friend is like 5‚Äô4

Saitama:
Ah

Chiaki:
rof debuff is good

Saitama:
10 minutes left

Saitama:
Need to finish this last E-4 run.

Brazzendausken:
as long as under 5'6" it shouldn't matter

Saitama:
O_O

salty emp:
but sadly she's not top tier

Draconex:
I dont think i did any runs today lul

Draconex:
Oh well

SSR Best Lamp:
Damn

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
she might work in some situations

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
might

SSR Best Lamp:
I‚Äôm just imaging it

Saitama:
Well

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
<:thonk9:410657576892497930>

SSR Best Lamp:
And I think it‚Äôll look amazing on her

salty emp:
aaaand thanks to discord i forgot to turn on fairy skills again

salty emp:
LOL

Saitama:
Even if you miss a few days you'll still make it in time.

Draconex:
LUL

Brazzendausken:
main question now is does your friend want to tho

Saitama:
You only need 10 full days of clears to get her.

SSR Best Lamp:
She does cosplays a lot

SSR Best Lamp:
So prob

Draconex:
Tru dat

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
also

SSR Best Lamp:
She‚Äôs also into anime

Draconex:
I need more l00d cosplays

Sparkee100:
Is ur friend a girl?  If not already failed cosplay :3

Draconex:
<:an94Lewd:484732598451699733>

Saitama:
Your friend might cosplay Super Sass?
<:SOPwao:465878170046955521>

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:


SSR Best Lamp:
Yeah

Saitama:
Oi

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
no more grind <:RibBleeding:415391866822066176>

Saitama:
<@!182627054892613632> Guys can crossdress too

SSR Best Lamp:
She has the same straight black hair

Saitama:
<:GudaCano:427805886757601280>

Saitama:
~~I'm a shining example~~

SSR Best Lamp:
I can get the hair accessory

Saitama:
Noice.

SSR Best Lamp:
She looks like super sass

Saitama:
And the rifle?

Saitama:
<:ump40Ehe:414074434035515392>

Sparkee100:
Crossdress guys need to be crucified for ruining waifu

SSR Best Lamp:
Rifle I will get

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
tried noel as adjutant

Saitama:
U-uwehhhh

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
it was a mistake

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
her lines are so

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
boring

Saitama:
Sparkeeeeee

SSR Best Lamp:
Rifle is still a work in progress

Saitama:
PLz

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
just like herself

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
<:RibBleeding:415391866822066176>

Saitama:
*oof*

Brazzendausken:
do you know where to find the PTS PRS stocks?

SSR Best Lamp:
But I will prob just take a SR25 or myCM16 I have laying around

Brazzendausken:
you will have to paint either part of it tan or part of it black

SSR Best Lamp:
<@!358751400576024578> I can get it off the market

Sparkee100:
‚ò¶ üò†

SSR Best Lamp:
I‚Äôll have to prob paint some parts

SSR Best Lamp:
But I can do it

Brazzendausken:
do people sell them?

Brazzendausken:
<@242811085931937802> I'm doing that with softair

Kane:
Hey I was too when I shot it

SSR Best Lamp:
Airsoft?

SSR Best Lamp:
I‚Äôm also gonna do it

Brazzendausken:
but AR10's don't exist in airsoft

SSR Best Lamp:
Prob gonna take a CM16 and cnc a new receiver

DocPropane:
can you imagine how m2's boobs must jiggle when she fires her gun?

Brazzendausken:
which means I have to hope people can't tell the difference between an SR25 and AR10

Kane:
I try not to

Chiaki:
it's important to not think about that

Chiaki:
<:pp90blush:425688701633298434>

SSR Best Lamp:
Rip

SSR Best Lamp:
I‚Äôm gonna CNC a AR10 receiver

Kane:
Sorry buds, 416 is all I need

SSR Best Lamp:
Cause I wanna be spot on

SSR Best Lamp:
Or I could take a GHK M4 and modify the firing group a little

SSR Best Lamp:
But a SR25 would be the best option I guess

SSR Best Lamp:
Don‚Äôt wanna spend too much time

HazardousJay:
yeah

Brazzendausken:
isn't it just the Armalite AR10?

HazardousJay:
your best bet is the SR-25 lol

SSR Best Lamp:
Yeah

SSR Best Lamp:
What I love about CNCing is that you can add accurate stamp texts

Brazzendausken:
yeah, my main gripe is the mags

SSR Best Lamp:
ü§î

Brazzendausken:
people say that people won't notice a STANAG

SSR Best Lamp:
You know what would be very stupid

Brazzendausken:
which is probably a lot more noticeable than a different gas block

SSR Best Lamp:
Expand the mag well to take scarH mags

Chiaki:
<@!194978774155001857> yet another run, not a single crit missed

Brazzendausken:
the problem is that the Super SASS takes modified M14 mags

Chiaki:
i'll try running 99% to see if i get noncrits because this is weird

Brazzendausken:
and we don't have that in airsoft

SSR Best Lamp:
Scar H mags are pretty similar to it visually

SSR Best Lamp:
I don‚Äôt like M14 mags for their rather confusing orientation

Brazzendausken:
Scar H mags? don't they just look just like SR25 mags with the crimping?

SSR Best Lamp:
It‚Äôs everyday where I put the mag in upside down

+Neptune+ (Lawyer-san):
Whom became NTR?

SSR Best Lamp:
Yeah, very similar

SSR Best Lamp:
Everything else seems easy to get

SSR Best Lamp:
The stock would prob just be an ICS with some paint

Brazzendausken:
I guess for cosplay purposes you could just make a 3D printed prop mag that is proper

KDaeho:
Bulli me sheeple

Brazzendausken:
without the crimping

Brazzendausken:
they have PTS PRS stocks

Brazzendausken:
but they are sorta pricey

20thSentryFox:
<@84323276083433472> ü§î
I'll just go and confirm it with other users. I could be wrong and i'm just getting old from all the updates to the game ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

Chiaki:
much appreciated

20thSentryFox:
<@84323276083433472> ah wait. Seems i was wrong. Got fed the wrong info lul

Chiaki:
oof

Kane:
<:ShotMink:410655372840402945>

Sparkee100:
What info

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
88% crit rate cap?

Chiaki:
yes

Sparkee100:
Really?

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
so the cap really is 100%?

SSR Best Lamp:
Oof we need a super sass cosplay

Chiaki:
yeah the cap seems to be 100%

SSR Best Lamp:
I think I could get my friend to do it

Chiaki:
read my other posts above

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
seems like I can put hoxy back

SSR Best Lamp:
She sort of resembles super sass

Chiaki:
too lazy to copy paste

Sparkee100:
<:g36Lazy:481469060589027329>

Sparkee100:
Scrolling is hard

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
actually attempted to put hoxy away

SSR Best Lamp:
Now to find a over coat and naval uniform

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
<:SOPMODfunnyfeic:427804752701554719>

SSR Best Lamp:
Or Japanese school uniform

SSR Best Lamp:
Whichever it is

Kane:
greatcoats have always been fashionable and always will be

SSR Best Lamp:


SSR Best Lamp:
Is that a Japanese school uniform

SSR Best Lamp:
Or a naval uniform

SSR Best Lamp:
I can‚Äôt really tell

Kane:
both

SSR Best Lamp:
How nice

Kane:
poque no los dos

SSR Best Lamp:
Gonna be easy to find

Sparkee100:
So do you need contender to get 100% crit?

SSR Best Lamp:
Cinco de mayo

Brazzendausken:
but its the PROP THAT MATTERS

Brazzendausken:
what's your plan?

Chiaki:
no, you need any crit tile

SSR Best Lamp:
Apparently it‚Äôs ma-yo, not May-o

Chiaki:
5-7, ppk

Sparkee100:
ü§î

SSR Best Lamp:
<@!358751400576024578> asked r/Airsoft

SSR Best Lamp:
Everyone called me autsitic

Sparkee100:
I'ma check it out

SSR Best Lamp:
It went well

SSR Best Lamp:
Expected nothing more or less

Brazzendausken:
are you pepsisky?

SSR Best Lamp:
Pepsisky?

SSR Best Lamp:
The anti virus company?

Brazzendausken:
some guy named PepsiSky asked r/airsoftmarket for parts to build Super SASS

SSR Best Lamp:
Oh

Brazzendausken:
with GFL Super SASS as the post pic

SSR Best Lamp:
Lmao

SSR Best Lamp:
Why r/airsoftmarket

SSR Best Lamp:
I don‚Äôt like intricate

Arcus:
More ROF than Lee but less damage

Kane:
understandable

Arcus:
i think

DocPropane:
I feel ya

20thSentryFox:
<@84323276083433472> don't forget the rng. One test run isn't enough. Also, sometimes the damage counter can get covered by the other ones so it may appear that ypu're critting more than you are, as 88% is still a majority

SSR Best Lamp:
DP28 art overloads my eyes

DocPropane:
type 95 has the same idea

Kane:
nothing pops out, shes the gal in the middle of the glass who the animators dont draw the face on half the time

DocPropane:
simple yet elegant design

Arcus:
what are lee's stats again

Chiaki:
yeah but that's still over 10 nodes without missing a single crit, sentry

DocPropane:
fashionable clothes

DocPropane:
big ass titties

SSR Best Lamp:
Jesus G28 is so lewd

DocPropane:
ikr

Kane:
wait really-

Kane:
oh

SSR Best Lamp:
Super SASS the best

SSR Best Lamp:
Cute

SSR Best Lamp:
Simple

Kane:
wow that IS lewd

SSR Best Lamp:
Lovable

Kane:
I gotta start remembering to look down from their faces

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
damn

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
G28 is a drop

Chiaki:
14 nodes without missing a crit seems a little crazy, considering i missed a shit ton when i didn't have 100% crit on first node

DocPropane:
hahahhaha

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
grinding again?

20thSentryFox:
<@84323276083433472> in that case i have no idea. Other users have done tests and have confirmed it to be the case. I'm actually only regurgitating info atm

DocPropane:
oh fuck

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
<:RibBleeding:415391866822066176>

Tsukicchi:
<@!197917022623891466> *hug*

DocPropane:
god that's why i quit kancolle

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
I don't want to grind

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
<:roCry:414084703323160576>

Chiaki:
i'll run another one with 100% crit just to confirm

20thSentryFox:
But the 88% is real

Kitsune:
?

Kitsune:
G28 is also attainable from heavy production

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
much later after AW

SSR Best Lamp:


Kitsune:
she's not out for EN yet

DocPropane:
cause i stayed awake till 3am once, till literally the last minutes of an event, trying to get graf zeppelin to drop

Chiaki:

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:

Brazzendausken:

Chiaki:
LD player is also a good option

Chiaki:

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:

Kane:

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
let's see now

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
oh

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
a 4* M14?

Chiaki:
<@!194978774155001857>  so uh 88% being the cap is either false or i'm lucksacking crits like a motherfucker 

i did a simple test

put svd on a team without crit tiles on her and ran a node, more often than not she would shoot a non crit bullet, because 88%.

next node, i put ppk and contender tiles on her, more than capping crit rate above 100%, all of my shots so far have been crits, and i cleared the map twice with that setup

DocPropane:
g28 looks like a big tiddy akko

Kane:
ikr

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
RoF 39

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
+65% dmg

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
119 base dmg

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
<:thonk9:410657576892497930>

SSR Best Lamp:
Look up Super SASS

SSR Best Lamp:
Super cute

Kane:
G28 has such a carefree face, I love it! Put me in a sister sandwich..

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
4 RoF lower than war goddess

Arcus:
4* M14

DocPropane:
what I love

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
but much higher dmg

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
hmm

Arcus:
But better base damage

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
<:thonk9:410657576892497930>

DocPropane:
is how the buttons are straining to hold the shirt closed

Arcus:
So really

Kane:
SASS looks...cute. but is very...plain

SSR Best Lamp:
That‚Äôs why I love her

Arcus:
4* Lee

DocPropane:
girl next door

DocPropane:
I mean 88% is still pretty damn good

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
a RF with scope

SSR Best Lamp:
100% for rifles would be deadly

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
= capped crit?

Kane:
100% crit makes me sweat bullets

Chiaki:
<:thonk9:410657576892497930>

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:

G28 would be a logical tagalong of 404..sister of 416 and all

+Neptune+ (Lawyer-san):
5-7 will split your lungs with blood and thunder.

DocPropane:
I think any HK AR could be a 404

masho the goat üêê:
The fight

+Neptune+ (Lawyer-san):
As your last voodoo for her worked

masho the goat üêê:
Cause I can't get seither

DocPropane:
for the fight, retreat the dolls when they get targeted

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
*it's seithr, why do people call it seither*

DocPropane:
put them in the x formation so that inly one can be targeted at a time

masho the goat üêê:
O.o

20thSentryFox:
946/865/646/450

c3:
either mow her down with superior fire power before she nukes you, or move your squad into x position, retreat whatever doll gets targeted. ez

+Neptune+ (Lawyer-san):
Brb

masho the goat üêê:
Ohhh

AsILie:
Ill pay good vbucks for anything that gives me something other than 2 stars or STG

masho the goat üêê:
That's clever

Reaper:
What's a good MG recipe

Kane:
whats wrong with STG, she storms rifles

masho the goat üêê:
Awesome thx

masho the goat üêê:
I'll try it out

DocPropane:
the rating depends only on the danage you actually *take*

AsILie:
I had* 12

AsILie:
Then i needed core

AsILie:
For better ars

+Neptune+ (Lawyer-san):
2:15

+Neptune+ (Lawyer-san):
<:RibBleeding:415391866822066176>

DocPropane:
also, the superior firepower thing only really works if you can deal huge damage in one shot

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
0 cores left

calico and IWS are pricy

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:

5 stars are pricey

+Neptune+ (Lawyer-san):
The voodoo taketh away

Arcus:
back to the 0-2 mines

DocPropane:
at 50 and 25 percent she gets invincibility, but if you can nuke her in one shot she'll skip that

AsILie:
They're the lambos to the budget options toyta Corolla

DocPropane:
or so I heard

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
but I must dummy link them

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:

HazardousJay:

HazardousJay:
<:mk48LUL:500681251733110785>

Saitama:
The ultimate loop to the cycle.

salty emp:
stasi

salty emp:

*oof*

Chiaki:
i guess stasi is the law

Kane:
>Using M16
I think 416 would shoot me

Chiaki:
i have come to accept

HazardousJay:
Team 404 feat. M16

Ashina:


HazardousJay:
or fine. AR-15 i  guess lul

20thSentryFox:
You guys were discussing the relevance of ump40 as a 404 member, so i just told you why not

20thSentryFox:
<:fncFat:502098769379196928>

Kane:
As much as I enjoy M16A1 as a drinking buddy, I can never tell 416 I do

Chiaki:
that's not untrue

Saitama:
<:GudaCano:427805886757601280>

HazardousJay:
easy kane

HazardousJay:
you invite HK416 on a drinking session with M16! <:fncFat:502098769379196928>

Kane:
....

Kane:
Im drinking jack RN so theyre with me in heart

Chiaki:
416 fumbling to make a sentence and m16 just laughing

HazardousJay:
someone buy Kane a HK416 and M16 Daki

20thSentryFox:
<@338162337519239180> why not put springfield inside ribeye's tiles? Ribeye's skill work regardless of gun type

HazardousJay:
<:ump40Ehe:414074434035515392>

20thSentryFox:
Skill only, not tile

Kane:
but im pretty sure 416 would shoot 16, me, then herself

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
and then M16, when drunk

DocPropane:
do we even know why we're not supposed to give booze to 416?

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
calls HK416

Chiaki:
well, she didn't in the story

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
"HKM4"

Chiaki:
she had chances

Kane:
HEY

Saitama:
Wait

Rib's skill works on everyone?

Kane:
She's nice to have

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
it works on all guns

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
tiles work on AR

Saitama:
Huh.

Saitama:
TIL

HazardousJay:
is keeping a Dupe ribeyrolles worth it

Chiaki:
as long as someone is inside her tiles, her skill will benefit them

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
probably not

Saitama:
Ehhhhh

Chiaki:
i don't think so

HazardousJay:
i forgot i have a spare ribey lel

Chiaki:
dupe a handgun instead

Saitama:
You could?

Saitama:
More AR teams.

Saitama:
Though we have M4.

Chiaki:
at least you can put handguns in any team

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
I'm using ribey with type sisters

DocPropane:
ye

HazardousJay:
i guess

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
buff the 15s sisters

DocPropane:
unless you plan on fielding 3 ar teams at the same time

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:

Kane:
Im merely trying to slave to 100 on my first echelon and x5

Chiaki:
<:OK:500692128058572800>

salty emp:
>duping babushka

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
too much crit

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
must go 140%

SSR Best Lamp:
Katyshua?

20thSentryFox:
99% is useless. Crit is capped at 88% anyway

20thSentryFox:
<:springTea:427818533431410691>

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
that's new

IDW_DA_NYAAAAA:
I didn't know it's capped at 88%

AsILie:
Is it worth actually training zas

Kes"Maki"Zachnyik:
Nepu

Kes"Maki"Zachnyik:

McSparky:
I'd snuggle that tummy faster than anything....

skaianDestiny:
```Terras: Don't assume 12 isn't athletic just because she has an ample figure. She was originally developed with an emphasis on developing and delivering explosive bursts of strength. The price of maintaining such a high degree of power output is a high rate of energy consumption, so SPAS needs to consume lots of energy pills and carbohydrates to maintain her fighting strength and her skin's impact resistance.```
```Terras: That said, she doesn't have the outstanding mobility of other dolls. However, it's child's play for 12 to punch through walls with her bare hands or kick armored vehicles around. However, these "big eater's qualities" have led to 12's ample frame, and she is quite concerned about them.```

you could substitute makarov/astra

Kitsune:
essentially

Kitsune:
you have to stack as much RoF as possible to make her work

Kitsune:
since she lowers her RoF with her skill

Kitsune:
<:g36Lazy:481469060589027329>

Shiro:
Since she loves rof isn't noel an option as well?

Kitsune:
but noel doesn't have an RoF buffing skill

Kitsune:
like stechkin, 57 and calico

Shiro:
But rof tiles

Kitsune:
???

ASCEE:
RoF buffs are better

ASCEE:
than the tiles themselves

Kitsune:
the dolls i mentioned have great tiles and rof buffs

Kitsune:
that make them way better than noel

Kitsune:
as much as noel is cute, she's bad

Kitsune:
<:RibBleeding:415391866822066176>

Yeah, but not everyone has 57 xD
